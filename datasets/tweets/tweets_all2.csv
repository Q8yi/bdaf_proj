2790,AndreCronjeTech,438709.0,2024/04/03 1:42:40,"Every so often we see something new in this space. I often find myself on the mid curve for an extensive amount of time. I am comfortable here. That being said, there have been events in this industry I wish I was more curious about, there have also been events I definitely did not see coming. UST I had a high degree of confidence would fail, the mechanisms simply didn't make sense to me, however, a lot of people I consider to be very smart were very vocal about how it can't fail, this reached a point where I was convinced ""I was wrong"". FTX, I did not think would fail, when asked by people if I think they should withdraw, my default response was ""yes, why take the risk"", but this is my default response for any exchange held assets. I did not see that one coming. I add this preamble to state that often, I simply don't know.

That being said, there is a new primitive that is gaining a lot of traction, and I am seeing it integrated into protocols I considered to be very low risk, but from my (perhaps incorrect) understanding, this new protocol is very high risk. So instead of naming or finger pointing, I wanted to ask those smarter than me, where I am getting it wrong, I have been through all available documentation, I have read others assessments, but I still do not see how the risk vectors are mitigated.

So first, the components of this;

Perpetual contracts - in a normal spot trade, you simply buy the asset (more specifically you sell one asset [shorting that asset] and buy the corresponding asset [longing that asset], for example in a BTC/USD trade, you are buying (longing) BTC, and selling (shorting) USD. Should BTC appreciate in value against USD, you made profit. We refer to these as spot trades, because you have the underlying asset, even should BTC/USD depreciate, you still have the BTC asset. A perp trade is an instrument that allows similar trading but without needing either of the assets involved in this trade, somewhat of a directional gamble instead of a trade. A very unique mechanism of a perp trade, is that both buyers (longers) and sellers (shorters) need to pay ""funding rates"". If there is significantly more buying demand than selling demand, sellers would receive ""positive funding"" and buyers would receive ""negative funding"", this is to ensure that the perp price gravitates towards its spot price (this mechanism is the same as lending interest rates). To keep your position open, you need to provide margin, the margin is really just collateral to ""fund"" your ""funding rate debt"". Should the funding rate turn negative, it eats away at your collateral, until your position is closed.

Margin / Collateral - the next part of this mechanism is yield based collateral, assets that increase in value just by holding it, in this case stETH. So if I have 1 stETH, I am long stETH, so if I open up a 1 stETH short perp position, I am (in theory) ""neutral"". Since even if I lose $100 on the stETH short, I gained $100 on the stETH long. Now I am ignoring that the only place that I could find that accepts stETH as margin collateral is ByBit. And the above also ignores funding rates.

The mechanism - the theory here is that you can generate a ""stable"" $1000, by buying $1000 of stETH, using this as collateral to open a $1000 stETH short, thereby achieving being ""neutral"", while getting the benefit of the stETH yield (~3%) + whatever is paid in funding rates.

Now, I am not a trader, other than some exploratory trades to build defi stuff I am happy to acknowledge this is not my domain of expertise. I try to compare these instruments with the lowest common denominators I know, which is collateral and debt. And in my experience, eventually you need to either close position (no longer neutral), or get liquidated. So now I assume the theory here is, ""when the markets turn, the position is simply closed"", but that is a bit like saying ""just buy BTC while it is going up, and sell when it is going down"", this is a meme for a reason, because ""it sounds obvious"" but in practice near impossible to achieve.

So while things are going great now (because market is positive and shorting funding rates are positive [because everyone is happy being long]), eventually that turns, funding becomes negative, margin/collateral gets liquidated, and you have an unbacked asset.

The counter to that is ""law of large numbers"", which is pretty much the same as UST's $1bn BTC fund etc. ""It works until it doesn't"".

So I would like to ask the greater wisdom of CT to help me understand where I am wrong and what I am missing.",374.0,False,-1.0,-1

Multichain hack - we are the only chain still actively trying to recover funds from users, with frequently released updates on this as recently as 04/03 https://t.co/9rXJOUsTsQ

This was not a hack, it was a seizure, so until the process runs its legal course, we can't simply back it with treasury, since if it resolves, people can claim their original losses and then we would simply be out of pocket for the double dip. 

Fantom's leadership, is not just me, its Kong, Sam, Quan, Juan, Scholtz, Jakub, Joe, and many others. I also have not stopped working at Fantom since 2018. I left yearn after I had handed it over to a team that did far better than it than I, same with Keep3r. One of my core beliefs is to find someone that can do a job better than yourself, and then let them do it. This is one of my leadership principles, I apologize if you see that as temperamental. 

Solidly, my discussion thereof was very clear, it is completely immutable and decentralized, the second it launches, I cannot change anything even should I require to do so. True decentralization does not have a founder, this was by design, as one of my core beliefs is to always promote true decentralization, I apologize if you see that as ""leaving all the users holding bags"", even though my hands off stance was clearly communicated.

His situation has been eating away at me and I have chosen to only talk about it in private until now. But I believe it is important that more people feel free to discuss these situations, so I may as well start with myself. 

The reason this situation is disturbing is because I could have been Daniel Penny. We both served in the military and deployed overseas. The military trains young men to stand up for what is right, especially when defenseless women and children are being directly threatened by a credible threat. 

If my wife and children were on that subway car alone, I pray that a young man like Daniel Penny would step in and protect them.

I have paid close attention to Penny trial. The evidence is overwhelming that Daniel Penny did exactly what we should hope every young man in the country would do in that situation ‚Äî he put himself in danger to protect women and children.

After putting himself in danger and gaining control of the situation, every innocent citizen was able to safely escape the situation at the next train stop. The police arrived and Jordan Neely was still alive. 

But here is the insane part ‚Äî the police did not administer first aid because they were scared for their own personal safety. They felt there was a risk of contracting HIV.

Imagine a scenario where a young man is willing to put himself in danger to potentially save innocent bystanders' lives, but the police deem the situation so risky when they show up that they are unwilling to put themselves in the same danger. 

That is the definition of what a hero does. 

If we live in a society that tries to punish young men for doing the right thing‚Äîfor protecting women and children that are in danger‚Äîthen we will live in a society that is overrun by criminals.

That is not the society we want to live in. 

The jury is currently deliberating the fate of Daniel Penny. They just told the judge that they are deadlocked and can not reach consensus. 

This means there is at least one courageous individual in that jury room that is refusing to go along with the charade. Whoever that individual is, may we hope they continue to stand strong in the face of immense pressure.

Daniel Penny acted heroically on that subway train and now his freedom depends on a fellow citizen doing the same thing in that jury room.

That‚Äôs why Elon is by far the greatest founder of all time.

Remember ‚Äî countless startups die just while trying to put stationary beige boxes on desktops. Very smart people get crushed by supply chain disruptions, or China tariffs, or lockdowns, or shipping interruptions, or regulatory delays.

Not Elon. He didn‚Äôt just survive financial crisis and coronavirus. He managed to build physical things in America while fighting the state and the laws of nature at the same time.

Somehow he managed to simultaneously build not just a car company but a rocket company. Those don‚Äôt just have ‚Äúmoving parts‚Äù, they are a moving whole.

The difficulty level here is insane. Hardware is completely different from software. One recall, just one serious bug, can destroy your company. If you are charging $50 for something that costs $40, and you need to recall and replace a million units, you‚Äôre usually dead.

So just one of these companies ‚Äî just Tesla, or just SpaceX ‚Äî would be an incredible accomplishment for anyone. Even a very intelligent and hardworking person would have to live an incredibly boring, disciplined, focused life to possibly maintain the extremely low error rate needed to profitably ship such complex products.

Not Elon. He did SpaceX and Tesla while having N children by K women. While also cofounding OpenAI and Neuralink and Boring Company. While fighting and defeating countless journalists, politicians, haters, and short sellers. And of course while buying Twitter, posting all the time, and building a following larger than almost any politician.

The better you are, the better you understand how much better Elon is. If you‚Äôre good at math you appreciate Ramanujan‚Äôs greatness.

Fran√ßois asks a good question. My answer is: France doesn't care about crime, they care about control.

1) First, Macron hasn't wiped out crime among 70M Frenchmen with all the power of the French State. So it's completely unreasonable to expect Durov to wipe out crime among 1B+ Telegram users with his minimal power of content moderation.

2) Second, the deeper point is that the French state is deeply uninterested in public safety! They allow violent crime, fundamentalist terrorism, and drug dealing to run rampant in France. Just compare Paris to what it was a few generations ago.

3) Third, is Macron held personally responsible for every beheading, rape, and robbery that occurs on French soil? Is he jailed when traveling for violating the human rights of French citizens by not ""moderating"" his community hard enough? No, he is not. Even though the tools of the French state are vastly greater than those of Telegram, over a vastly smaller userbase. Again: Macron has ~70M citizens to deal with, while Telegram has almost 1B users.

4) Finally, we already know what a real anti-crime policy looks like. It looks like @nayibbukele. And President Bukele is for encryption, and has invited programmers to build on El Salvadoran soil ‚Äî an offer they'd be well-advised to take up.

5) So: France is an anarcho-tyrannical regime. It doesn't need sophisticated surveillance to stop drug dealing ‚Äî¬†because it's all happening in public! They know exactly where the criminals are, and the victims too. They are literally setting up spaces for them to do drugs till they die.

Here are four things MAGA is getting wrong, and why it's handing over the world to China.

(1) First, MAGA correctly understands that America‚Äôs economic position is in decline but thinks this is due to economic competition itself, rather than lack of competitiveness.

(2) Second, MAGA also understands that the US has wasted trillions abroad in foreign wars, but thinks the problem is global leadership itself rather than poor leadership.

(3) Third, MAGA knows that their Blue American enemies have allies abroad, but has incorrectly overreacted to this by treating every non-Red-American as an enemy.

(4) Fourth, MAGA sees the billions of dollars flowing from the US to foreign recipients, but isn't grasping that the US can only print those dollars in the first place so long as it's the hub of a global empire.

When you put these together you can both understand MAGA's actions and understand why they will not lead to the intended result.

Basically: MAGA is hyperfocused on cutting off any apparent flow of funds from Red Americans to Blue Americans and non-Americans. And they only have ~500 days in power. So they're trying to quickly shut off imports, close down institutions, and exit all wars.

OK.

Except the reason the imports exist in the first place is because US products aren't competitive relative to Chinese products (or Fed printing). The reason those institutions exist is because the US set them up to run the world. And the reason those wars are happening is not because of American leadership per se, but because of the absence of good leadership.

3206,balajis,1161089.0,2024/06/29 3:37:06,"CHEVRON DOMINANCE

Technology is about to accelerate.
Because Chevron deference is over.
And regulators can't just make up laws anymore.
So, countless new startups just became feasible.
This is often spoken about in the abstract, so let's do three examples and two visuals.

THREE EXAMPLES

1) Genomics. Did Congress explicitly give FDA authority to regulate genetic tests in a bill like Kefauver-Harris (1962) or PDUFA (1992)? No, it did not. But in the early 2010s, FDA attacked 23andMe and forced them to take personal genomic tests offline. Implicitly, this was under Chevron.

2) Nuclear power. Did Congress explicitly give EPA and NRC the authority to implement ALARA? No, it did not. But these agencies came up with this ""as low as reasonably achievable"" standard, forcing nuclear energy to become as expensive as other energy sources by spending all the cost-savings on ""safety."" Implicitly, this was under Chevron too.

3) Cryptocurrency. You guessed it. Did Congress explicitly give the SEC authority to regulate crypto? No, it did not. Cryptocurrencies didn't exist when the 1933 and 1934 acts were written. However, the SEC says it has regulatory authority over crypto, even when Congress is deliberating on bills to the contrary. Implicitly, that claim of SEC authority too was under Chevron.

In other words: if a regulator can't point to the law that gives them the power, they may not have the power. And you might be able to win in a court of law.

So! For technology, the overruling of Chevron could literally reopen innovation in the physical world. This is on par with the 1991 opening of the Internet to commercial traffic. It deprecates the 20th century regulatory state. All the safety theater and security theater that they optimize for sounding good while actually being bad now has to face judicial scrutiny.

TWO VISUALS
How to visualize something as abstract as Chevron reversal? Well, Chevron is the company on which the 1984 Chevron deference case is actually based. And its logo had the arrows pointed down. But now that Chevron has been reversed, we're headed up. 

And that's one way to visualize what reversal means: from Chevron deference to Chevron dominance. Because rule-of-law now dominates the lawless regulatory state. If the regulator isn't specifically authorized by statute, they can't invent some regulation to stop your innovation.

But there's a second way to visualize the reversal of Chevron: regulators just got disarmed, in the most literal sense. Because ultimately a regulation is a threat of state force. If you disobey one of a regulator's made up rules, they eventually get a cop to point a gun at you, implicitly or sometimes very explicitly.

^ The photo above is from the 2010 FDA raid on Rawesome Foods for selling raw milk to club members that consciously opted in to eating and drinking foods of their own choice. This may have also been done under Chevron deference because FDA only has the right to regulate interstate commerce, and not commerce within one state (which is all that Rawesome was apparently doing at that time).

To be clear, I don't have a position on raw milk other than I do think people should be able to choose their own foods. In their lawsuit against the Farm To Consumer Legal Defense Fund, FDA strongly disagreed, contending that ""there is no generalized right to bodily and physical health"" and you ""do not have a fundamental right to obtain any food they wish.‚Äù These are real quotes from the now-defanged regulators; see the PDF link below.

Anyway ‚Äî¬†now you get a sense of how big a deal the Chevron reversal is, and how out of control regulators can get. The Chevron reversal strips regulators of the ability to make up random rules. It calls all their existing made-up rules into question. And it gives you the power to ask where in the law it says they can make up some new rule.

You know that saying ‚Äî¬†the only way they can stop you is to shoot you? Well, now they can't shoot you as easily. So we're going from Chevron deference to Chevron dominance.

This time, the central bankers, the banks, and the bank regulators have lied to all dollar holders and depositors.

This isn't your typical fractional reserve situation. The problem is that there isn't enough in the banks on a mark-to-market basis to cover withdrawals. They knew this through all of last year, and communicated it internally in their coded language.

It's obvious from the graphs (see below). The central banks, the banks, and the banking regulators all knew a huge crash was coming ‚Äî the phrase is ""unrealized losses"" [1,2,3,4,5]. But they never notified you, the depositor.

Instead the regulators allowed banks to hide their literal insolvency in footnotes[6], until one guy figured it out[7].

It's Uncle Sam Bankman Fried. Just like SBF used your deposits to buy shitcoins, using accounting tricks to fool himself and others into using the money, so too did the banks.

They all used the deposits to buy the ultimate shitcoin: long-dated US Treasuries. And they all got rekt at the same time, in the same way, because they bought the same asset from the same vendor who devalued it at the same time: the Fed.

Specifically, as NYT admitted, banks ""binged"" on enormous amounts of Treasuries and other long-term bonds in 2021 when the flood of printed money cut off their typical demand for loans, and because they thought the Fed would keep interest rates low forever.[8].

And they had good reason to believe this. Powell said he'd be ""patient"" on rate hikes as late as Nov 3 2021[9]. Then he got renominated on Nov 22 2021[10], and hiked rates much faster than anyone had expected ‚Äî which even Yellen[11] and the FDIC[12] admit caused the current banking crisis.

Why did Powell delay? Probably for political reasons. Presidents don't like rate hikes[13], especially running into the election year of 2022. And Powell thought he could wait and just be like Paul Volcker[14], who was ""firm"" and then defeated inflation.

But the world isn't an 80s rerun. Hiking from ten years of near zero interest rates in the 2010s was a surprise attack on every dollar holder. Economics isn't politics - the kind of insane flipflops you see in politics don't work when there are actual contracts involved.

So anyone who bet on long-term Treasuries got killed in 2021. And now, anyone who bets on short-term Treasuries is going to get killed in 2023. The absolute worse place you can be is to have large amounts of assets locked up in three month treasury bills. The ~5% interest rate offered by big banks (G-SIBs) is a trap. Most fiat bank accounts are now a trap, for those countries whose central bankers followed the Fed.

And that is actually why anti-Indian sentiment is rising. Not because Indians are so weak, but because Indians are once again becoming strong.

CEOs of companies.
Leaders of countries.
Founders and investors.
Doctors, writers, professors.
Not just slumdogs.
Millionaires.

Now, I know what people will say.
Not all Indians are doing well.
More than a billion are still poor!
And of course that‚Äôs true, and will be for a while.

But Indians abroad have risen as individuals:

And India is now rising as a country:

Indeed, India is the fastest growing large economy in the world over the last decade:

And I think Indians have a lot of headroom left. Where does it end up? We don‚Äôt know, but if even 5% of 1.4B Indian nationals are at the same level as the ~5M strong Indian American diaspora that currently produces ~6% of US tax revenue, that‚Äôs ~70M people capable of producing ~72% of current US tax revenue.

So I think it‚Äôs at least possible that India returns to its historical level of relative prosperity:

As a plausibility argument, recall that before America was even a twinkle in anyone‚Äôs eye, Marco Polo sought out China and Columbus risked his life to trade with India. So those civilizations were giant economic centers for thousands of years.

And are becoming so again.

This perspective demands a different approach. Not the victim mindset where Indians mimic Western wokes in whining piteously upon every slight. But a mature, tit-for-tat morality befitting a rising people where you cooperate with those that cooperate, ignore what is best ignored, and (proportionately) punish only when necessary.

Because even from a purely realpolitik standpoint, constant cancellation doesn‚Äôt work. Recall that wokes tried that for the last decade, and all it got them was epic political defeat. They overused the penicillin called anti-racism,  and now we have antibiotic-resistant actual racism.

Indians will need different tactics. And that starts with moving from victim mentality to Vedic mentality, if you'll permit the poetic license. Because India isn't just a rising civilization, it's a returning civilization. And wokes are proven losers, but Indians can be winners.",1505.0,False,-1.0,-1

A historical speech. Here is Donald Trump's full speech at the Bitcoin Conference with timestamps and transcript.

TIMESTAMPS
1:36 - Shoutouts to David Bailey, Winklevosses, Michael Saylor, Cathie Wood, Ron Paul and Rand Paul, Vivek, and the victims of the July 13 assassination attempt.

7:00 - How Bitcoin rose from an idea on an anonymous message board to the 9th most valuable asset in the world.

10:00 - America is a nation in decline, and we cannot let China dominate Bitcoin. The US must lead in tech, science, manufacturing, AI, space, and power generation.

14:50 - Bitcoin will be mined, minted, and made in the USA. If it goes to the moon, it'll get there from America. 

16:20 - How the Biden/Harris administration has waged war on crypto for the last three and a half years, by choking off banking support.

22:00 - The Biden/Harris administration is against Bitcoin, because it stands for freedom, sovereignty, and independence from government coercion and control.

25:00 - The day Trump takes the oath of office, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren's anti-crypto crusade will be done. He will fire Gary Gensler on day one!

27:57 - Trump commits to immediately shutting down Operation Chokepoint 2.0, and creating a Bitcoin and Crypto Presidential Advisory Council. In 100 days, fair rules written by people who want crypto to thrive.

29:28 - There will never be a CBDC. And he will defend the right to self-custody, freedom of transaction, freedom of association, and freedom of speech.

30:25 - He'll support USD stablecoins and global savings in Bitcoin. And he recognizes that the behavior of the current US government is the threat to the dollar, not Bitcoin.

35:30 - Biden/Harris has presided over the biggest inflation in the history of America.

38:30 - Inflation destroyed Weimar Germany. Bitcoiners understood inflation better than anyone else. Inflation is stealth taxation, a national disgrace.

43:30 - Make the US the lowest cost energy producer in the world, given its natural resources, and turn it into a Bitcoin mining powerhouse. Americans will not need to move to China.

44:20 - The US government has violated the cardinal rule: never sell your Bitcoin. He will stop the US government from selling its Bitcoin. This will serve as the core of the strategic national Bitcoin stockpile.

46:00 - He will commute the life sentence of Ross Ulbricht to time served.

46:26 - He commits to becoming the pro-innovation, pro-Bitcoin, and pro-tech president that America deserves. And will make America and Bitcoin stronger, richer, freer, and greater than ever before.

So. Suppose your US company imports $1M of high quality parts, and adds in its own components to produce finished goods sold for $1.2M per batch. Your gross profit is $200k per batch.

But wait! Suddenly a new 30% tariff is imposed on that $1M of parts. You now have to fork over $300k to customs before you sell anything. That‚Äôs cash you probably don‚Äôt have. Oh, and even if you do sell everything, you‚Äôre now losing $100k per batch.

With a sinking feeling, you realize your profitable business which you somehow managed to keep in America all these years has suddenly become unprofitable.

You post online about how bad this is but get shouted down by an angry mob, convinced that capitalists like you should die. You can‚Äôt tell nowadays if they‚Äôre on left or right.

Moreover, you don‚Äôt have the time, money, skills, or tools in house to build that $1M of parts yourself. You are being asked to do the equivalent of growing a maple tree when all you needed was a little maple syrup. So now you are faced with several tough choices. 

(1) First, you may need to go into debt or fire people to quickly come up with the $300k in cash to pay for these surprise tariffs at customs. Even if the tariff might go away, it might not, so you have to get the cash somehow or risk having your shipment impounded.

(2) Next, you might need to reduce quality to stop losing $100k on each batch. You could order the lower quality $750k parts, grimace and pay 30% tariff at customs, and hope you can build and sell for the same price of $1.2M per batch despite the lower quality.

(3) Alternatively, you could keep the quality parts at $1M and instead raise prices to $1.5M per batch to get back your original margins of $200k per batch, which you need to pay employees after all. But that‚Äôs a big hike that your customer will probably not welcome, given that he‚Äôs likely dealing with his own tariff shock.

So: these tariffs don‚Äôt really give an incentive to build in the US. Because it‚Äôs far more expensive to build a screw factory than to pay even high tariffs on a foreign screw.

Instead what they likely mean is debt, layoffs, lower quality, and higher prices for any US company that buys parts abroad.

The Fed now has ‚Äúhigh rates‚Äù like SF has ‚Äúlow crime rates‚Äù. It says it does, but it doesn‚Äôt.

Because you have to be pretty naive to think today‚Äôs rate hike means the Fed is still ‚Äúfighting inflation‚Äù. You can see it in the graphs ‚Äî the printing is already vertical[1,2], and trillions in new money is available for both domestic[3,4] and foreign[5] banks. Yet the Fed continues hiking rates to fool low information voters into thinking the last two weeks were just an isolated series of multi-hundred-billion dollar bank failures, and that their policy is unchanged. Nothing to worry about, the Western banking system is resilient, and it‚Äôs normal to have banks die at the rate of five in ten days![10]

Because that‚Äôs actually all this state does: it fakes the rates.

Remember when SF claimed officially low crime rates[6] even as criminals robbed stores in broad daylight[7]? Remember when FDA prevented labs from testing so we all underestimated the COVID infection rate[8], till old people in New York started dropping dead? And remember when the Fed claimed the inflation rate wouldn't be a problem[9] before anyone buying groceries found out it was an emergency?

The American state fakes the rates.

And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening with today‚Äôs ‚Äúhike‚Äù. After killing five of their own banks[10], catalyzing a series of bank runs[11], and realizing the public now knew they‚Äôd made hundreds more banks insolvent[12,13], the Fed rolled out programs over the last two weeks that broke the normal relationship between ‚Äúhiking rates‚Äù and ‚Äútightening monetary policy‚Äù.

All the losses the Fed rate hikes cause for domestic banks?
They‚Äôre printing money to cover it.[14]
All the losses they cause for foreign banks?
Printing money to cover that too.[15]
And the losses they cause for depositors?
Naturally, more printed money![16]

So now the banks don‚Äôt publicly die from bank runs. Instead, even as this rate hike keeps pushing bank stocks further into the ground[17], and banks further into insolvency[18], the banks know they can just get more printed money (eg at the discount window[19] for BTFP) to cover their losses. That‚Äôs what BTFP, the swap lines, and the effective ‚ÄúFedDIC‚Äù policy mean: infinite money.

And this infinite money is no longer abstract. It‚Äôs printed dollars that individuals touch directly when they wire their money out of banks they fear may collapse, which is happening everywhere from community banks[20] to Credit Suisse[21].  The money printer is now connected directly to your checking account. And in the digital era, the bank runs are of a historical scale.[22]

Remember also: the BTFP, swap lines, and FedDIC measures are *so enormous* that the Fed is doing them over weekends[23] with all the other central banks[24], and publishing multiple joint statements[25,26] assuring people that the ‚Äúsystem is resilient‚Äù, even as Moody‚Äôs has downgraded the US banking system as a whole[27].

One of the things I hate about this system is that it‚Äôs evolved to be opaque, like a snake that‚Äôs evolved camouflage. If the Fed came outright and *said* they were digitally devaluing the dollar by printing trillions, that they were monetizing the debt as Dalio predicted[31] and even getting bondholders to abet the devaluation, everyone would flee for the Bitcoin exit. So instead they lie, to themselves and to others, just as Jean-Claude Juncker recommended[32].  As with CDOs[33] in 2008, the point is to fool themselves and to fool you.

But you have to see through the camouflage. They‚Äôre printing trillions[34,35] even as they‚Äôre hiking rates. Indeed, they‚Äôre printing trillions to compensate for the *consequences* of hiking rates. There will of course be other consequences to printing trillions. You can wait to find out, or you can get into Bitcoin now.

And we have plenty of day passes for visitors.

THE DARK TALENT
As motivation, I‚Äôve always wanted to expand equality of opportunity around the world. Because my father was born in a desperately poor country, but with the right opportunity he was able to make something of himself. Like dark matter, he was dark talent. And for more than a decade I‚Äôve been thinking about how to give others who are similarly situated the chance to make something of themselves. That is: I‚Äôve been thinking about how to empower the dark talent of the world.

US universities used to fill this role, even imperfectly, and I loved Stanford when I taught there years ago. But the data shows they‚Äôve declined in recent days. And they‚Äôre just not affordable or accessible to most of the world. So, it‚Äôs time for a new approach. And thanks to Saraswati and Satoshi, I have the resources to endow a new Internet-first institution: the Network School.

The purpose of the Network School is to articulate a vision of peace, trade, internationalism, and technology‚Ä¶even as the rest of the world talks about war, trade war, nationalism, and statism. To revitalize democracy for the internet era, with digital polities and verifiable votes. To train the next generation to be not just leaders of companies, but inspirations for their communities. And to pursue truth, health, and wealth by leveling up our attendees personally, physically, and professionally.

Let me now describe in more detail how the Network School works, who it‚Äôs for, and how to apply.

HOW THE NETWORK SCHOOL WORKS
The Network School is for people of all ages, not just the youth. And it‚Äôs meant to be lifelong rather than one-off, with both a structured and and an unstructured component. The structured part is about continuous daily self-improvement: learning skills, burning calories, and earning currency. Meanwhile, the unstructured part is about having fun and hanging out with people of similar values.

For short: learn, burn, earn, and fun.

Learn
The first part of the Network School is about learning technologies and humanities.

As motivation, the existing model of US undergraduate education is broken. You pay $100k+ for a four year degree, and then budget nothing for maintenance over the course of your life. It‚Äôs like paying $100k+ for a new car and budgeting nothing for maintenance.

By contrast, the Network School is about continuous education. It‚Äôs for remote workers, engineers, creators and digital nomads who want to integrate learning into their lives, rather than stopping everything to be a full-time student.

Here‚Äôs how that works. We set up mini-classrooms where you can drop in to see the problem of the day.5 You solve that problem and a proctor awards you a cryptocredential, a free non-transferable NFT sent to your crypto wallet that establishes ‚Äúproof-of-learn.‚Äù Often your solution will involve putting code on GitHub/Replit (to show you understand a concept), or posting content to your social media profile (to show you understand a new AI tool). And over time, these cryptocredentials actually build up a cryptoresume proving what you know.

Our initial material focuses on founding tech communities, as distinct from tech companies. As such it touches on everything from crypto, AI, and social media to history, politics, and filmmaking. It should be useful even if you‚Äôre just growing a traditional company or building a following. Over time, of course, every branch of the sciences and humanities becomes relevant when building a community. So if this initial experiment works, we can expand branch-by-branch to build a new kind of university.

But we‚Äôre intentionally starting with something simple. Our learning is about continuous education, about solving the problem-of-the-day.

Burn
The second part of the Network School is about burning calories.

Longevity is important, but 20th century communities just aren‚Äôt physically set up to maximize physical fitness. Quite the contrary: the default mode of Western society is sedentary and sugary. Those who want to escape this need to roll their own nutrition and workout program, which takes time, money, and energy.

We‚Äôre changing that. I‚Äôve teamed up with my friend @bryan_johnson to set up Blueprint-inspired food and fitness for the entire Network School community. Bryan will be on campus to set up the program, and then his designates will maintain it on a daily basis. Like many of you, I‚Äôve been both fit and fat at various times, so this is a product I want to use myself.

Every member of the Network School gets a daily workout slot with a semi-personal trainer, much like a group fitness class. You run and lift in the morning at your chosen time, getting a proof-of-workout from your trainer. Your group holds you accountable for showing up. Then you get a box with your Blueprint-optimized healthy meals and head to work. The whole point is to provide willpower-as-a-service, where the community6 provides the discipline.

We‚Äôre starting with the basics of running, lifting, eating, and sleeping properly. The initial goal is to hit the limits of your genetics. But if all goes well, the biotech founders that come to the Network School will eventually help us all surpass our genetic limits, to live much longer than we otherwise would.

But again, we‚Äôre starting small! And so the ‚Äúburning calories‚Äù part is about lifelong health and the workout-of-the-day.

Earn
The third part of the Network School is about earning currency.

We‚Äôll have crypto prizes of the day for open source projects, AI content creation, and microtasks. There will be $1000 bounties every day for the duration of the program, similar to the various prizes I‚Äôve posted on Twitter and Farcaster. And community members will post their own prizes.

Next, in keeping with the overall theme of self-improvement, we‚Äôll have office hours to help with your job, your career, your visa status, and your funding. We‚Äôre much more invested in you than a typical college career center because our interests are aligned: the more you earn, and the stronger you are financially, the more you‚Äôll eventually have to reinvest in the community.

Finally, we‚Äôll have visitor hours with famous visiting technologists. As my friend Sriram noticed, when investors come through Singapore I typically do a podcast with them. Many will also visit the Network School to meet attendees, invest in them, or hire them. Others will give remote talks. And you can see the quality of visitors from the speakers in our conference and podcast.

So, earning is about constant career development and the prize-of-the-day.

Fun
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, of course. So the fourth part of the Network School is about fun.

This is the unstructured component. It‚Äôs most of what you‚Äôre here for. It‚Äôs just about assembling great people in one place: positive-sum people who believe in technological progress, internationalism, and capitalism. It‚Äôs your internet friends, coming from URL to IRL. Stanford introduced the concept of residential education, but this takes it to the next level.

In fact, our initial location is very similar to Stanford. It‚Äôs beautiful and sunny, and less than an hour from a major city (Singapore) with an international airport (Changi). That means you can be heads down during the week, head into the city on the weekends for fun, and get to just about anywhere in Asia within the same day. This is convenient for the >50% of the world that lives within the Valeriepieris circle.

We‚Äôll do some group outings too, but most of the fun will be up to you.

WHO THE NETWORK SCHOOL IS FOR
Who is the Network School for? There are four lenses on this: demographical, ideological, professional, and personal.

Demographically
As mentioned, our focus is the dark talent. The more respect you have for legacy institutions, and the more respect they have for you, the less suitable you‚Äôll be as an applicant.

So: the Network School is for Indian engineers and African founders, for makers from the Midwest and the Middle East, for Chinese liberals and Latin American libertarians, for Southeast Asia‚Äôs rising technologists and Europe‚Äôs remaining capitalists.

It‚Äôs for everyone who doesn‚Äôt feel part of the establishment. But it‚Äôs definitely not only for tech, because a community does not run on tech alone.

Ideologically
Ideologically, the Network School is for people who admire Western values, but who also recognize that Asia is in ascendance, and that the next world order is more properly centered around the Internet ‚Äî around neutral code ‚Äî than around either declining Western institutions or a rising Chinese state.

For example, the Network School is for those who understand that Bitcoin succeeds the Federal Reserve, that encryption is the only true protection against unreasonable search and seizure, that AI can deliver better opinions than any Delaware magistrate, and that democracy can be rejuvenated with cryptography. It is for those who believe in technology, harmony, internationalism, and capitalism. It‚Äôs for those who want Silicon Valley without San Francisco. And for those who want to found, fund, and find not just new companies and currencies ‚Äî but new cities and new communities.

Professionally
Our ideal applicant is capable of remote work, or has enough savings to support themselves while at the Network School. For our initial cohort, we‚Äôre seeking three major groups of people in particular:

- Writers, artists, influencers, and filmmakers
- Trainers, athletes, coaches, and clinicians
- Founders, engineers, designers, and investors

These are, roughly, the demographics focused on learning, burning, and earning respectively. Of course, if you fall outside those categories but still think you have something to contribute, you should still apply to the Network School.

Personally
I should mention that the Network School is a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù that I built for the young version of myself ‚Äî¬†the aspiring young engineer. This is the community I want to live in: a technocapitalist college town, a Stanford 2.0 that‚Äôs globally affordable and genuinely meritocratic.

So, I‚Äôll be on campus full time. Bryan Johnson and I are supervising the setup of everything from bench press to French press. And we‚Äôll eventually be recruiting faculty in the form of content creators, fitness influencers, and angel investors for the learn, burn, and earn portions of our program respectively. But all that in due time.

APPLYING TO THE NETWORK SCHOOL
Ok, so how do you apply to the Network School?

Just go to ns dot com and click ""apply."" We‚Äôve set up a simple Luma page where you can apply in a few minutes. Then, if you pass review, we‚Äôll send a second application where you pay rent. As mentioned, our monthly rent is $1000 (with roommates) and $2000 (solo). We also have daily and weekly rates too, but short-term visitors still need to apply.

The rent gets you an air-conditioned room on a beautiful island, with internet, gym, and access to all courses and community services. You‚Äôll still need to handle your flights and pay for your food, but we think the overall package is extremely affordable. And so the Network School could be an amazing option for individuals or small teams looking to save money, get fit, and level up while living in paradise.

I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing you there! Just fill out the application at ns dot com, also linked in the tweet below.",1173.0,False,-1.0,-1

During the time the account was compromised, unauthorized posts containing links to scam websites (some referencing SingularityNET related crypto tokens) were made.  To anyone who clicked on those links, I sincerely apologize for any distress this may have caused.

Upon discovering the hack, I immediately took action to inform the community by asking SingularityNET to post daily notices about the breach.  Additionally, SingularityNET helped me to retain a security team to expedite the process of regaining control.

I am cooperating with Twitter and the relevant authorities to investigate the incident and prevent such occurrences in the future; and I urge anyone who has been affected to report the scam to the appropriate authorities and to take necessary steps to secure their accounts and personal information.

This is my own personal Twitter account that I set up myself in 2009, it has not hitherto been managed by SingularityNET or TrueAGI or any other company in which I have a role.   However, observing the heightened attention that the recent ASI merger seems to be bringing from hackers and scammers, going forward I will be leveraging assistance from SingularityNET's IT team on security matters regarding my personal social media accounts.

That said, yes, I feel some of our experimental proto-AGI software does display interesting elements of self-awareness..

What I actually said to the CoinTelegraph reporter which led to this article, placed my thoughts on this in context properly, which the headline obviously does not...

First of all if you are interested in how I'm thinking about human-like consciousness, from my perspective as an AGI researcher, please look at this paper

https://t.co/iwThmRHChJ

among other sources.

If you're interested in the approach my AGI dev team (separate but cooperating with SingularityNET/ASI's decentralized platform team) is taking to building human-level AGI, take a look at

https://t.co/EEbNu3aQML

for an overview and https://t.co/vWu44o8we2 for more info...

Finally, for a hint at the work toward relatively simple forms of AI ""embodied, agentic self-awareness"" I mentioned to the CoinTelegraph reporter, please see

https://t.co/sqFahq9DEa

So basically, my point that led to that headline was something like this...

1) Current LLMs are quite smart at answering some kinds of questions and synthesizing some kinds of products, but they are not really embodied agents in a fundamental sense... a ChatGPT instance does not center its interactions around a sense of who and what it is, what environment it's in, who it's interacting with and with what purpose, etc.

2) An AI system like a Neoteric ""digital organism"" living in Sophiaverse virtual world (back-ended on an OpenCog Hyperon system deployed on SingularityNET etc. etc.), is founded from the get-go on informational exchange between its internal dynamic knowledge metagraph and its environment, and the other agents with which it shares its environment.   Its knowledge of the world grows in terms of a system of abstractions that it creates in its knowledge metegraph, based on asking ""what abstractions will be most helpful for me in achieving my goals in the world I perceive, together with the other agents I perceive myself to interact with""

In this sense, I argue that even fairly simple Neoteric type agents have more self-awareness than current LLMs, even if the latter are better at a lot of practical tasks.

I note that at SNet and ASI, we are working on this kind of fundamental AGI research, and also at building various practical commercial AI systems, including putting LLMs together with knowledge graphs for various vertical applications including DeFi, TradFi, Biomedicine, music, visual arts, etc. etc.

Regarding the term self-awareness, as I noted both in the CoinTelegraph interview and in the paper on consciousness linked above, I tend to be panpsychist and believe everything in the multiverse down to the elementary particle level has some element of awareness and consciousness.  But some entities have a higher degree of self-awareness than others, and it's important to understand that -- among intelligent systems in general just as among humans -- degree of self-awareness is not necessarily proportional to degree of practical intelligence.

Anyway you may disagree with me on all or much of the above, of course these are matters where serious and well educated experts have a variety of different opinions, but I hope you'll see this is not a matter of ""some web3 guys making wild senseless claims to get PR"" ... I have been working on AGI since the 1980s and introduced the term ""AGI"" in 2005 and  got into blockchain simply because I thought I had a viable path to actually building AGI and it seemed important that once I finally got there, it would be rolled out on a democratic and decentralized platform...

I don't delude myself such confusion can be easily remedied but as the one who inflicted the ""AGI"" concept upon the world way back in the Dark Ages, I can't resist posting a simple clarification of what these terms generally mean to folks in the AGI research world...

Bearing in mind of course these are still somewhat fluid, cutting-edge concepts on which there is no consensus...

AI -- any software or hardware doing something that people consider smart when people do it

AGI -- Artificial General Intelligence -- AI that can generalize imaginatively and fluently beyond its training data and its programming.  

[There is a math theory of AGI, e.g. Marcus Hutter's book ""Universal AI"" and a lot of other papers, but it's pretty general and doesn't give you specific practical AGI tests.   This math theory does make clear that humans are pretty low on the theoretical scale of potential levels of GI. ]

[ There are also practical tests like Francois Chollet's AGI-ARC that try and partially succeed to measure general intelligence in a way that spans human and AI... humans do well on them and current AIs including all LLMs do very poorly.]

HLAGI --  Human-Level AGI -- AI that has cognitive capabilities overall similar to a normal adult human, including human-like ability to generalize imaginatively beyond its training data and its programming

ASI -- Artificial Superintelligence -- AGI that is massively beyond the human level in general intelligence.  

[ASI is expected to come with the ability to self-analyze and self-modify to a level far beyond HLAGIs ... so ASIs will almost surely be way superhuman in building new ASIs ...]

[Note also that even after we have ASI, humans may have some unique value to offer, just as the plants in the Amazon and our gut bacteria have some special emergent collective properties that are valuable to us even though our general intelligence presumably exceeds theirs.]

... and what comes after ASI?

Ultraintelligence?  AI that masters paraconsistent closed timeline loops and turns large portions of multiverse into physical instantiations of its post-quantum mindstuff?

3421,bengoertzel,71311.0,2025/01/13 12:26:25,"Yes clearly we have not achieved Human-Level AGI yet in the sense in which we meant the term when we published the book ""Artificial General Intelligence"" in 2005, or organized the first AGI Workshop in 2006 or the first AGI Conference in 2008 ... the things that put the term on the map in the AI research community...

What was meant there was not merely having a generality of knowledge and capability similar to that of a typical humans (and to be clear o3 isn't there yet, it's way superhuman in some ways and badly subhuman in others), but also having a human-like ability to generalIZE from experience to very different situations... and no LLM-centered system I've seen comes remotely close to this.   I have not had a chance to play with o3 so I can't say for sure but I would bet a lot that it still has similar limitations to its predecessors in this regard.

Modern LLM-centric systems come by their generality of knowledge and capability by a very interesting sort of learning which involves -- loosely speaking -- extrapolating a fairly small distance from a rather large volume of information.   Human-like AGI involves some of this learning too, but ALSO involves different kinds of learning, such as the ability to sometimes effectively cognitively leap a much longer distance from a teeny amount of information.   

This more radical sort of ""generalization out of the historical distribution"" seems to be (according to a lot of mathematical learning theory and cog sci etc. etc.) tied in with our ability to make and use abstractions, in ways that current transformer NNs don't do...

Exactly how far one can get in practice WITHOUT this kind of radical generalization ability, isn't clear.   Can AI systems take over 90% of the economy without being able to generalize at the human level?  99%  I don't know.  But even if so, that doesn't mean this sort of economic capability comprises human-level AGI, in the sense that the term AGI has historically been used.

(It's a bit  -- though not exactly -- like the difference between the ability to invent Salvador Dali's painting style, and the ability to copy Salvador Dali's painting style in a cheap, fast, flexible way.  The fact that the latter may be even more lucrative than the former doesn't make it the same thing....  Economics is not actually the ultimate arbiter of meaning...)

About the AGI-ARC test, when Chollet presented it at our AGI-24 event at UW in Seattle in August, I pointed out after his talk that it clearly is only necessary and not sufficient for HLAGI.   What I said is (paraphrasing) it was fairly easy to see how some sort of very clever puzzle-solving AI system that still fell far short of HLAGI could pass his test.   He said (again paraphrasing), yeah, sure, it's just the first in a series of tests, we will make more and more difficult ones.  This all made sense.   

I think o3 model kicking ass (though not quite at human level) on the first AGI-ARC test is really interesting and important ... but I also think it's unfortunate that the naming of the test has led naive onlookers and savvy marketeers to twist o3's genuine and possibly profound success into something even more than it is.   It appears o3 is already in real life a quite genuine and fantastic advance.  There is no need to twist it into even more than it is.  Something even more and better will come along soon enough !!

I have found @GaryMarcus 's dissection of the specifics of o3's achievement regarding AGI-ARC interesting and clarifying, but I still find what o3 has done impressive...

Unlike @GaryMarcus , I come close to agreeing with @sama 's optimism about the potential nearness of the advent of real HLAGI ... but with important differences...

1) I somewhat doubt we will get to HLAGI in 2025, but getting there in the next 3-4 years seems highly plausible to me....   Looking at my own projects if things go really really well sometime in 2026 could happen... but such projects are certainly hard to predict in detail...

2) I don't think we need to redefine the goalposts to get there....  I think automating the global economy with AI and achieving HLAGI are two separate, though closely coupled, things... either one could precede the other by some number of years depending on various factors...

3) I don't think the system that gets us to HLAGI is going to be a ""transformer + chain of thought"" thingie, though it may have something along these lines as a significant component.   I continue to believe that one needs systems doing a far greater amount of abstraction (and then judicious goal-oriented and self-organizing manipulation of abstractions) than this sort of system can do.   

4) However I do think transformers can provide massive acceleration to AGI progress via serving as components of hybrid architectures, providing information feeds and control guidance and serving many other roles in relation to other architecture components....  So I do think all this progress by OpenAI and others is quite AGI-relevant even though these transformer-centric systems are not going to be the path to AGI unto themselves in a simple way...

5) I think it will be for the best if the breakthrough to HLAGI is not made by closed corporate parties with ""Open"" in their name, but by actual open decentralized networks with participatory governance and coordination... which is how all my own AGI-oriented work is being done...

I've used o1 fairly extensively... it's a significant and exciting step forward but there are also clear limitations

For example --

It's pretty good at programming in languages for which there are numerous examples on the Internet (or numerous examples for quite similar languages).  It does very poorly at our MeTTa language, even after lots of creative attempts to teach it...

It's pretty good at dealing with math theorems and proofs in domains of math for which there are a lot of published papers in its corpus.  It's piss-poor at things like paraconsistent logic for which the existing literature is smaller and sparser.

Basically, to oversimplify a bit, it's got ""chain of thought"" down to a science, answering questions via synthesizing numerous chains of thought behind the scenes, and then presenting only a summary approximation of its actual chains of thought to the user...

However it doesn't represent a fundamental leap beyond prior LLMs, in the sense that it is still clearly recombining its training data on a fairly surface level...

If this were to be the apex of AI, we would have a serious societal issue due to such models, in that they render it SOOO MUCH EASIER to do conformist stuff that copies what other people are doing.  I mean, it takes a lot of persistence and stubbornness to bother creating a weird new programming language when it means you will not have LLM programming assistance for a significant while... or to invent an out-there new branch of math when it will mean going without math theorem-proving assistance.  Similarly in music, pioneering a new genre of music will seem even less appealing to most composers when it means their AI music assistants becoming so lame....

However, I think that before this sort of ""AI driven accentuated pressure for conformity"" becomes a major factor, we will replace LLMs with different sorts of AGI architecture in which LLMs play only a supporting role.  Obviously that is what we're after with OpenCog Hyperon, which combines LLMs with logical reasoning, evolutionary algorithms and other methods. within an autonomous agency based architecture ... and which is designed from the get-go for decentralized implementation, atop e.g. SNet +. Nunet + HyperCycle...

OpenAI does have a bit of a lead now in terms of practical LLM capabilities, with o1 ... although I'd note DeepMind's neural models are better at some other things like planning and strategy... .however I definitely predict OSS LLMs will catch up with o1 within a year or so at most... everyone can see now  basically how to systematize chain of thought the way OpenAI has done, it will just take some time and resources for others to do the experimentation and tuning...

Ilya noted previously that Sam's ego could be a problem.  Quite possibly, but the OpenAI Board's ego is evidently a problem as well.  The broader flow of human cognition, inspiration and compute resources toward the creation of AGI is a bigger, broader thing than any of these.

After years of litigation, millions of your taxpayer dollars spent, and irreparable harm done to the country, we reached an agreement with SEC staff to dismiss their litigation against Coinbase. Once approved by the Commission (which we're told to expect next week) this would be a full dismissal, with $0 in fines paid and zero changes to our business.

This is hugely vindicating, especially because many people questioned my decision to engage in litigation with the SEC on this matter in 2023. People told me the courts would give a lot of leeway to the government. They said public market investors wouldn't like it. They said it would take years and cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal fees (which it did). They said the agency would use mafia tactics like trying to pressure other companies not to work with us while the lawsuit was underway (which they did).

But I knew a few truths that helped make it an easy decision to fight them in court:

1. The SEC was wrong on the law.
They were exceeding the authority given to them by congress by asking us to delist a number of assets that were not securities. We had taken a conservative approach to ensure we weren't listing any securities, and the SEC itself had allowed us to go public in 2021 after reviewing our listing standards in depth. We tried to ‚Äúcome in and register‚Äù but it turned out it was a fake offer, as every crypto company discovered. Regulators are supposed to enforce the law, but they can't make up new laws on the spot if they don't like the current ones, or weaponize a lack of clarity in the law.

2. Caving to their demands could have killed the crypto industry in America.
The SEC made it clear to us that the only way to avoid litigation was to delist the many assets they falsely claimed were securities. It was a bullying tactic, pure and simple, driven by Gensler's own political agenda. And if we had caved, it would have dramatically limited the scope of which crypto assets were allowed in the US, and pushed the industry further offshore, into the shadows. Never forget how close a few activists in government came to unlawfully killing an entire industry in America! It could have easily gone the other way. Thank goodness the founding fathers created the judicial branch, as a check and balance on executive power.

3. It was the right thing to do for our customers and the industry.
At the end of the day, it didn't matter what our chance of success was. I had to stand up for our customers‚Äô and our industry‚Äôs rights. I also knew it would serve as a deterrent for future bad actors around the world we may have to engage with, for them to know that we won't be bullied or pressured. We are comfortable engaging in litigation across multiple fronts, indefinitely, while continuing to build. This is business as usual. As Bain in The Dark Knight says, ""you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it"".

Growing up I had a naive view that regulators exist to hold companies accountable. What I realized in this ordeal is sometimes, companies must hold regulators accountable who are painting outside the bounds of the law, to preserve freedom. Accountability can actually happen both ways. At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom, and I initially thought we could achieve this solely through our crypto products. But I'm increasingly realizing that we can move the needle on economic freedom in the courts and through our policy efforts as well, when we see bad actors in government around the world. We plan to do more of this.

I have to give credit here to the Trump administration, for winning the election, and for the departure of  the activist head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, who orchestrated this unlawful action along with Elizabeth Warren, and a handful of their lackeys in congress. I feel confident we would have won this case in the courts either way, given our facts were so strong, but it certainly helped accelerate the process and drive accountability. I called out the sketchy behavior of the SEC back in 2021, and I believe this comment turned out to be prescient.

I want to give a shout out to all the other crypto companies who fought back with their own lawsuits (we certainly were not the only ones).

I want to give a shout out to all the crypto startups who couldn't afford the legal fees, and went bankrupt due to the administration's abusive tactics. Your company may have died, but crypto lives on. Don't stop building.

I want to give a shout out to both Democrat and Republican members of congress, who are working hard to ensure America leads on crypto. I know that Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren do not represent the entire Democratic party.

And I want to give a shout out to all the crypto holders in the US who elected pro-crypto candidates, on both sides of the aisle, to make sure your rights were preserved. It turns out the crypto voter is real, and showed up in the millions.

Finally, I expect we'll continue working productively with the SEC on any number of items over the years, just as we do with every agency around the world where we operate. I look forward to the SEC being reformed under Paul Atkins, Mark Uyeda, Hester Peirce, and DOGE, and new more sensible personnel coming into leadership roles. I commend the new leadership that is already in place for working to right this wrong - it's a great step in the right direction, and took courage.

Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I‚Äôve gotten some questions on how I think about them. I am personally not a memecoin trader (beyond a few test trades), but they‚Äôve become hugely popular. Arguably, they've been with us since the beginning ‚Äì Dogecoin is still one of the most popular coins. Even Bitcoin is somewhat of a memecoin (one could argue so is the U.S. dollar, once it was disconnected from gold). Just like the early days of the internet with animated gifs, new technologies often look like a toy but evolve into something much more powerful over time. So we should be open minded about where memecoins are going, even if some are silly, offensive, or even fraudulent today. Memecoins are a canary in the coal mine that everything will be tokenized and brought onchain (every post, image, video, song, asset class, user identity, vote, artwork, stablecoin, contract etc).

Coinbase differentiates itself by being the most trusted and easiest to use platform in crypto, so how are we approaching memecoins through this lens? From first-principles, we believe in free market capitalism. If our customers want it, and it's legal, we aim to let them make that choice for themselves. But it's our job to provide them with the best information we can find to make an informed choice. If a token is a scam or fraudulent, we'd want to remove it. But if it's just low quality, the customer should be able to see reviews or community notes, and make their own choice. (Defining what is an outright scam vs low quality is often a blurry line btw, so you need to be careful not to accidentally create a censorship regime.) We want to provide useful information to consumers, not play judge and jury or endorse/recommend investments.

Some memecoins have clearly gone too far lately, to the extent people are insider trading. This is illegal, and people should understand that you will go to prison for this. In every crypto cycle, there is a get rich quick crowd that comes and goes, and learns this lesson the hard way. Don't break the law! And don't try to get rich quick. You should get rich by contributing real lasting value to society (or at least be trying - it's not easy!).

So where do we go from here? We should purge the bad actors and lift up the people trying to build lasting value. We want to bring the next billion users onchain, and the only way to do this is to build products and services which people want. Help them earn a living, avoid high fees when sending money to friends and family, find truth about what's happening in the world, or get a loan to grow their business. Give them access to sound money and financial infrastructure, to accelerate progress in the world. Memecoins have a role to play here, and I think will evolve to help artists get paid, track trends, or who knows what - it's too early to say, but we should keep exploring.

The founding fathers were geniuses but (with humility) may have missed the adverse incentives which grow the size of democratic government over time (winning elections by promising more free stuff).

2023 was a great year for Coinbase and we‚Äôre in a strong financial position. We cut costs by 45% y/y and shipped products faster with a leaner team driving $95 million of positive net income for 2023, $964 million in positive Adj. EBITDA, and total revenue of $3.1B.

We launched the Coinbase International Exchange, derivatives products, the Layer 2 Base which is helping blockchains scale, and played a key role in the Bitcoin ETF approvals as the custodian for 8 of 11 ETF issuers.

Tradfi is adopting crypto and this is great for Coinbase. Bitcoin ETFs are now the second largest commodity ETFs in the U.S. (behind gold), and we custody around 90% of the ~$37B in Bitcoin ETF assets. We've seen net inflows across our retail & institutional products since the ETFs launched (i.e. no cannibalization).

In 2024 we'll focus on growing trading fee revenue with international expansion and derivatives. We'll also focus on driving utility in crypto with payments (for instance, you can now send USDC instantly for free on Base) and by developing Coinbase Wallet into an onchain superapp. Finally, we'll keep driving regulatory clarity for crypto via the courts, https://t.co/7Pqa8n17D9, SuperPac contributions, and encouraging legislation in DC.

We're in a strong financial position, our long term focus on compliance has proved to be right vs competition, and we're well positioned to help accelerate crypto adoption, updating the global financial system.

But you gotta stop minimizing how bad the L2 experience is.

If you're a crypto native, it's bad. More than bad, it's PAINFUL. That's if you already use crypto. If you're a newbie... it's unacceptable. Simply unusable. 

Using Ethereum means transacting across L2s. Ethereum is now a multi-chain ecosystem. 

Maybe the mint you really like is one chain, while the dapp you wanna airdrop farm is on another. Maybe you're a business like The Defiant, and get stables in three different chains bc that's where your clients have their cash. 

So no, the argument of, ""just use one chain and it's seamless,"" is not a solution. The vision of many chains working seamlessly within one umbrella ecosystem is not a solution either. The experience needs to be seamless across all L2s and mainnet. Or it just doesn't work.

and yes, I know there are technical solutions that are being worked on. but they're not here. and those that ARE here, aren't being implemented. What's the point of having account abstraction if almost no wallet and protocol is using it?

I wrote Read Write Own because I felt we needed a book that explains the full potential of blockchains and tokens, and how these technologies can support productive and not just speculative use cases. Sometimes people in the industry say things like ‚Äúspeculation is a bootstrapping mechanism that leads to utility.‚Äù That explanation might be sufficient for true believers, but it‚Äôs not for the rest of the world.

What I try to do is break down, in detail ‚Äì based on frameworks, experience, and research ‚Äì why a future internet built on these technologies would be better, and how exactly we might get there.

I like tech/science/business books that are authentic, that feel like I am overhearing conversations between colleagues, but are written in a way that non-specialists can understand. That‚Äôs what I tried to do. I wrote it as you‚Äôd hear me talk in daily conversations, except that I explain things from first principles, without assuming prior knowledge. (Early on, someone recommended that I write the book for ‚Äúsmart high school students,‚Äù advice that stuck with me.)

The book is simple and straightforward but in no way watered down. It is also concise: the main text is 230 pages despite covering a lot of ground (there are also 36 pages of endnotes ‚Äî much of the material came from my own experience, but I also conducted new research and incorporated feedback from about twenty expert readers). I cut out around 200 pages that didn‚Äôt feel essential. I also structured the book in roughly 3-4 page chunks that can stand alone, like blog posts, so that readers can skip around. Internet veterans will be familiar with the topics covered in some sections. Crypto veterans will be familiar with others. General readers should read end to end to get the full narrative. I hope everyone will find sections that are new and interesting to them.

I sent out advance copies a few months ago and was excited by the positive feedback. I‚Äôll be sharing more in the coming weeks, but for now here are some early blurbs that will appear on the back of the book:

‚ÄúThis book is a must for anyone who wants to better understand the real potential of blockchains and web3 to drive even greater innovation, inspire more imaginative thinking, and ultimately unlock new growth opportunities in the future.‚Äù ‚ÄîBob Iger, CEO, Disney

‚ÄúRead this book to understand a compelling vision of where the internet should go and how to get there.‚Äù ‚ÄîSam Altman, CEO, OpenAI

‚ÄúUnfortunately, the noise has overwhelmed the signal in the crypto industry over the last five years. Chris Dixon succeeds at explaining how crypto technology is vital to our technological future and how we all can benefit, much as we have from the internet. I would encourage all regulators and crypto naysayers around the world to read this book.‚Äù ‚ÄîMark Cuban

‚ÄúThis book changed my mind. It‚Äôs a clear manifesto for redeeming the internet and making it the democratic platform we all want. The hero in this story is a second generation of blockchains, tamed from their earlier excesses as speculative coins and remade into a way for everyone to own what they make online. It‚Äôs the best positive case for crypto I‚Äôve seen.‚Äù ‚ÄîKevin Kelly, bestselling author of The Inevitable

‚ÄúThis is a pivotal moment for the internet. Chris Dixon‚Äôs fascinating book offers a refreshing and radical new take at a time when we need fresh thinking more than ever.‚Äù ‚ÄîMustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Inflection AI and DeepMind, bestselling author of The Coming Wave

Aligned with that strategy, today we announced our contribution to the Fairshake PAC, which will work to elect leaders who champion thoughtful crypto regulation that balances innovation with consumer protection.

There is a battle in Washington about the future of blockchain technologies: certain policymakers believe it should be banned, while other people think it should have no guardrails. Neither of those options will allow the technology to reach its full potential and realign the future of the Internet away from Big Tech to the people who use it.

As I‚Äôve spent more time with lawmakers, it has become more apparent that the only way to counteract the lobbies of the big banks and big tech is to show that crypto and blockchain can be a force, too.

There are two parts to this, coalition building and raising funds to support the cause. That is what this PAC is all about ‚Äì bringing together responsible actors in web3 and crypto to help advance clear rules of the road that will support American innovation while holding bad actors to account.

While we won‚Äôt control how Fairshake spends our donation, we are encouraged by their vision. And we‚Äôll continue working to make sure our allies in the crypto world make their voices heard as well.

For decades, the internet has operated on an implicit economic covenant between creators and platforms: creators provide supply, and platforms provide demand. Writers allow search engines to index their articles in the hope of driving traffic to their sites. Artists upload images and videos to social networks to build audiences. The system worked because it benefited both parties.

Advances in generative AI are likely to break this covenant. A new wave of AI-powered search engines give comprehensive answers instead of guiding users to websites. Social networks are increasingly populated by AI-generated images and videos. These AI systems were likely trained on original, human-created content but often don‚Äôt credit or cite their sources. If there‚Äôs no attribution or compensation, what incentive will there be to publish original creations on the open internet?

Story is a blockchain protocol that allows creators to register their intellectual property so they can track and monitor use, ensuring their legal and economic rights are protected. This means that creators of original content are rewarded, no matter how their content gets used and distributed. Meanwhile, licensing IP becomes low friction and standardized, encouraging widespread sharing and collaboration. The goal is to create foundational infrastructure that can underpin a new economic covenant between creators and platforms.

Some examples of projects that are building on top of Story include @magma_com, @joinsekai, and Ablo by @spacerunnersnft. Magma is a collaborative art platform enabling artists to register their IP, set the rules of engagement (commercial, remixing, AI usage), and open up assets to contributions from collaborators. Sekai is an AI storytelling platform that helps storytellers, artists, and fans co-create immersive interactive stories via simple prompts. Ablo allows anyone to use generative AI to customize and remix the latest fashions, using Story to handle IP registration and creator attribution, and share revenue between designers and brands.

The team behind Story brings deep expertise from both the tech and creative worlds. We first met CEO/cofounder @storysylee three years ago, after he sold his company, Radish Fiction, to Kakao. He has consistently impressed us with his combination of big-picture vision and world-class tactical execution. His cofounder @jasonjzhao studied CS at Stanford, dove deeper into AI at DeepMind, and now leads technical development on the Story Protocol.

For AI systems and creative people to both thrive, creators need a modern way to ensure they get compensated for their work. Story takes a proven approach ‚Äî intellectual property law ‚Äî and updates it for the age of AI.

One of my favorite Munger sayings is: ‚ÄúShow me the incentives and I‚Äôll show you the outcome.‚Äù What I like about this quote is it is representative of Munger‚Äôs characteristic thinking about systems. Systems thinking means it isn‚Äôt enough to consider, say, a business or investment decision in isolation. Instead, a decision needs to be considered in the context of larger economic, legal, social, and cultural systems. It also means considering not just the 1st order but also the 2nd (and 3rd) order effects of decisions. Seemingly small changes to initial conditions can have cascading downstream consequences.

To do system thinking well, you need to be consistently learning and cultivate wide-ranging, multidisciplinary interests. As Munger said ‚ÄúNothing has served me better in my long life than continuous learning. I went through life constantly practicing (because if you don‚Äôt practice it, you lose it) the multidisciplinary approach and I can‚Äôt tell you what that‚Äôs done for me.‚Äù

The best way to read it is end-to-end, but it‚Äôs also broken into 3-4 page chunks to allow you to skip around.

A few comments:

I present a series of frameworks throughout, some of which readers might have seen me discuss before. In the book, I develop these frameworks in greater detail, and illustrate them with stories and examples. Most of the frameworks apply not just to blockchains but to software and internet technologies generally, including both classic internet services and emerging areas like AI.

Some of the frameworks in the book:

‚Üí The platform-app feedback loop
‚Üí Networks: the attract-extract cycle
‚Üí Skeuomorphic vs native applications
‚Üí Squeezing the balloon
‚Üí Come for the tool, stay for the network
‚Üí The next big thing starts out looking like a toy
‚Üí Inside-out vs outside-in technologies
‚Üí What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years
‚Üí Internet media: the attention-monetization tradeoff
‚Üí Computing cycles: Incubation vs growth phases

In terms of structure, the book has five main parts:

1/ Briefly covers the history of the internet, focusing on the two most recent eras from the early 1990s through today.

2/ Dives deeper into blockchains, explaining how they work and why they matter. Shows how blockchains and tokens can be used to construct blockchain networks (aka protocols), and explain the technical and economic mechanisms by which they work.

3/ Shows how blockchain networks empower users and other network participants, answering the ‚Äúwhy blockchains?‚Äù question people often ask.

2. Trump is also more popular amongst working and middle class folks. Most of these folks are also asset-light.

It stands to reason that a fall in asset prices (stocks down or home prices down) have very little impact on his core constituents. To that end, I won‚Äôt be surprised if Trump has little reaction, then, to an equity or home price market correction. 

Separately, the upside of shrinking these asset prices is that it gives the folks mentioned above a legitimate chance to buy into those markets at lower levels, making equity ownership and/or home ownership more possible. 

Tangentially, if Trump figures out how to get rents lower, he will unite young people and asset-light working people into a reliable voting block for the foreseeable future. He will have given them the trifecta: cheaper stocks, cheaper homes, lower rent. 

Said differently, don‚Äôt presume that the stock market going up is a useful barometer anymore. In fact, it going down may be a better signal for his popularity.

4. As a result of the increased interest rates and the signal to the market, investors are now concerned that the money they borrowed for free is no longer free and therefore they are unwinding their trades and sending the funds back to Japan.

Richard is a highly qualified leader and, with over three decades of financial services and regulatory experience, he will navigate the company through its next period of growth. He will ensure Binance delivers on our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth.

Prior to joining Binance, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM); Chief Regulatory Officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX); and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

With Richard and the entire team, I‚Äôm confident that the best days for @Binance and the crypto industry lay ahead.

As a shareholder and former CEO with historical knowledge of our company, I will remain available to the team to consult as needed, consistent with the framework set out in our U.S. agency resolutions.

What‚Äôs next for me?

I will take a break first. I have not had a single day of real (phone off) break for the last 6 and half years.

After that, my current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech. I am happy that I will finally have more time to spend looking at DeFi.

I can‚Äôt see myself being a CEO driving a startup again. I am content being an one-shot (lucky) entrepreneur. Should there be listeners, I may be open to being a coach/mentor to a small number of upcoming entrepreneurs, privately. If for nothing else, I can at least tell them what not to do.

On that note, I am proud to point out that in our resolutions with the U.S. agencies they:

- do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and
- do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.

Funds are SAFU!

With that, I look forward to seeing the new leadership take the reins. Please join me in congratulating Richard on his well-deserved promotion.

Onwards!

Giggle Academy has been going well, and will be a big part of my life for the next few years.

I will also dedicate more time and funding to charity (and education). I have some rough ideas.

I share my long explanation in our newly-published Blockchain Letter here: https://t.co/LcJN04ocbX

I'll summarize my thoughts below:

The old Wall Street adage worked literally perfectly in the last two big regulatory announcements in our space:

The day CME futures went live ‚Äî December 18, 2017 ‚Äì was the peak at $20k, the price fell 65% immediately and 84% at the ultimate lows.
The day Coinbase listed ‚Äî April 14, 2021 ‚Äì $65k, the price fell 54% immediately and 76% at the ultimate lows.
While starting a prediction with ‚ÄúThis time is different‚Ä¶‚Äù is not usually an auspicious way to begin, I believe it here.

Neither of those events had any impact on real world access to bitcoin.

It was all ‚ÄúBuy the rumor, sell the news.‚Äù

Bitcoin futures didn‚Äôt open up any significant new pools of investors.  They‚Äôre only interesting to a very small niche of mainly arbitragers.  Not much net new buying.

The Coinbase offering is even more clear.  Coinbase‚Äôs website worked great when it was privately held.  The next day, when it was publicly-owned, the website worked just the same.  The change in who owned Coinbase stock did nothing to increase access to bitcoin.

This is different.  A BlackRock ETF fundamentally changes access to bitcoin.  It will have a huge (positive) impact.

We strongly believe many spot bitcoin ETFs will be approved.  We also believe it will happen in a matter of a month or two ‚Äì not years.

I was at Goldman when they did the GSCI.  Now everyone thinks of Commodities as an asset class.  In the 90‚Äôs I was very active in emerging markets.  Now everyone thinks of EM as an asset class.  Blockchain will be just like that.  The existence of an ETF is a very important step in becoming an asset class.  Once an ETF exists, if you don‚Äôt have exposure, you‚Äôre effectively short.

I promise the stablecoin holders incredible liquidity.¬† With just one click on their smartphones, they can get their money back same-day ‚Äì in unlimited amounts.

When asked:

""Isn't 13-to-one leverage kind of aggressive on a stablecoin?""

I'm honest ‚Äì I tell everybody the truth:¬† ""If the risky assets go up, I‚Äôm keeping all the profits.¬† But, if they fall in value, I‚Äôm going to stiff the taxpayer.""

A very important theme now is the absence of bad things.

My full thoughts here: https://t.co/x0czBZmPNj

I'll summarize below.

The swings in global macro markets generally were beyond history.

2022 was the worst-ever year on record for U.S. bond investors.  It was also the worst year for the classic 60/40 stock and bond portfolio since the Great Depression.

Blockchain markets were hit with all that plus mega-crazy things like a 5-million-person crime by Sam Bankman-Fried and ludicrous leverage at a half dozen lending institutions.

In my opinion, these are all once-in-a-generation-type weird things.  Nobody's going to be lending to levered crypto hedge funds without collateral and no transparency again for 10 or 15 years.  (Having seen 25 years of cycles, I do know that somebody‚Äôs going to do it again in the next generation!)

Below is a visual of the wave of what many believed to be catastrophic events in blockchain‚Äôs history.
Since none of those could kill blockchain, the absence of those super bad things is, on the margin, a massive positive.

@PanteraCapital has been managing money in this space longer than anyone ‚Äì more than a decade of these maniac bull and bear cycles.  We've been through three full crazy cycles ‚Äì massive rallies, and then, unfortunately, 85% or so downdrafts.  I think we're in the beginning of the fourth big cycle now.

The stock market crashing in 2022 had a huge ‚Äúdenominator effect‚Äù on institutions ‚Äì and they really pulled back from investing in private markets. 
 With stocks back at record highs, they can invest in private markets again, and so I think the next 18 or 24 months are probably going to be a strong bull market for crypto.

This is a pivotal moment with the removal of these traumatic, horrible occurrences in the capital markets and blockchain space from the past couple years, coupled with positive things like the halving and regulatory clarity ‚Äì all unfolding simultaneously.

8 months ago I came here to this beautiful country with no expectations other than to learn what was happening in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi.

After spending time here and working closely with regulators, large enterprises, government officials and key individuals, I can confidently say that the UAE is the best home for innovative new technologies and digital ecosystems like IOTA. The leadership of the UAE has a strong vision of the future and they have the foresight, deep understanding and willingness to support innovative new technologies. Instead of being held back, innovation is enabled to thrive.

There is no country like the UAE, and I am proud to call it home now. I am incredibly grateful to have met some of the most amazing, supportive and open people. Without them this wouldn't have been possible and I'm forever grateful for their support and to be able to call them friends.

We are part of this ecosystem to build a generational technology with the potential to significantly improve our world and transform how we transact and do business in a global, digital society. We‚Äôre not here to build a better casino. We‚Äôre here to create a movement to disrupt today‚Äôs power imbalance and to create open, transparent and incorruptible systems. We‚Äôre here to empower people to finally be in control and to own their data, assets and identity. Instead of extracting value, we‚Äôre meant to create opportunities for those who are less privileged, and to enable them to participate in the value creation of our global economy. We‚Äôre supposed to create a future without borders, a truly global economy and society.

Somewhere along the way we‚Äôve lost our roots, forgotten about our principles and the future we are meant to create. A large part of our industry has devolved into a money making machine for those who want to get rich quickly. The last 2 years have shown the worst sides of Crypto. Ponzinomics, meme frenzies, influencers, narrative-driven hype and pump and dumps. It was about extracting value - not creating it. We were supposed to bank the unbanked, but we‚Äôve mostly created one of the greatest exit strategies for insiders to dump on retail. If all that we‚Äôve achieved is to make a bunch of nerds rich so that they can live in their mansions, then we‚Äôve collectively failed.

What is happening with the anti-crypto stance of the US is very unfortunate but it‚Äôs not surprising. Considering what has happened over the last year and how we‚Äôve let this industry be run by rampant scammers, grifters and thieves. Millions of people have lost their life savings because we‚Äôve given a handful of people too much power and have allowed them to build the exact centralized money houses we were meant to replace. All we can do is convince them that we're building real technologies that provide real value.

What is happening today should not discourage us from marching forward. We cannot afford to run our digital world on centralized systems which are controlled by a few. Only decentralized technologies that are impartial, incorruptible and unstoppable can create the future we need. We will only achieve this if we go back to our old ways, be rooted in principles and work on visions of a better future. Let‚Äôs stay focused on creating real value with the technologies, networks and ecosystems we‚Äôre building.

I'm convinced that we are on the right path to realize the potential of Crypto and prove all the critics and skeptics wrong. It will take time, but with the amount of talented builders, amazing creators and principled thinkers that are part of this industry we will march forward and go back to creating value.

We all ignored the huge red flags associated with SBF because ""he looked smart"" and ""he made a lot of money."" Then it turned out that he was dumb as rocks, was a sociopath, and was just stealing our money.

The next cycle is going to be even more noisy, with even worse behavior. It has become really easy to launch a trash L2, and it's fairly easy to do that trick, perfected by a certain chain that reorgs every other day, where you find someone who is actually doing real work and you parrot what they say, while angling for a photo op with Vitalik. So we need to be extra vigilant about the red flags that characterize trash L2s:

* Project narrative does not match project tech. E.g. centralized sequencers and layer-2s that lack fraud proofs are trash that is at odds with crypto.

* Projects that sell tokens now in order to raise money to do the work that will lead to some other technology later. Third prong of the Howey test has something to say about this, and it starts with S and continues with ecurity Offering.

* Founders dumping personal tokens pre-launch. Teams should be locked up. 8-figure sales pre-launch  in order to ""thank the staff"" are about as OK as SBF stealing everyone's money because he's an ""effective altruist.""

* Very low float tokens. SBF played this game of manipulating low-float token valuations and borrowing against them. Enough said.

* Founders complaining that they are running out of cocaine. I'm no moral police, but come on.

So how does one cut through the noise? There is a simple test. Crypto has just a few real blockers at any given time. For instance, in the last cycle, scalability and performance were the outstanding problems and Avalanche and Solana provided two approaches to tackle them. These days, I believe the blockers have to do with supporting multiple use cases on the same platform and integrating with TradFi -- but I might be wrong and others might have their own ideas of what blocks adoption by the next billion people. 

Whatever these blockers are, say them out loud and ask: ""Does this person bring something truly game changing to the table to address the biggest issues facing crypto right now? Would I invite this person to my family dinner and would they be able to explain why they are uniquely positioned to solve it?""

Quantum computing will make it easier to perform certain operations, like factoring numbers, while others, such as inverting one-way hash functions, remain just as difficult. Further, depending on the platform, a quantum computer has a small window of opportunity to attack. These two facts make the job of a quantum attacker fairly difficult.

The design of systems such as Bitcoin and Avalanche X/P Chain ensures that, when Alice sends money to Bob, Bob's public key is not revealed to the public. Instead, the world knows only the hash of a hash (so, two separate one way hash functions) of the public key. This means that the funds at rest are quantum resistant -- the attacker simply has no information to work on, he cannot be grinding away in the background. 

The public keys are exposed only when transactions are issued. So the quantum attacker only has a brief opportunity after he sees the public key in a transaction but before that transaction is incorporated into the chain. The faster the chain, the harder the problem. In the case of Bitcoin, the quantum attacker needs to break the key within 5 to 30 minutes. For Avalanche, the attacker only has 1 second, if that.

Finally, we already have a pull request for Avalanche that introduces lattice cryptography. Lattice-based crypto is built from the ground up to resist quantum attacks. We don't ordinarily use it because the signatures are about 10x bigger.

Overall, (1) we're seeing amazing work on quantum computing that we'd love to see more of, for the good of humanity, (2) realistic attacks on cryptocurrencies are still a long ways off, and (3) Avalanche is ready to roll out quantum resistant signatures very quickly once we decide that quantum attacks are on the horizon. For now, let's all watch how quantum computers develop over the next few decades.",369.0,False,-1.0,-1

Nothing will be able to rival the breadth and depth of the foundational Ethereum ecosystem wrt progressively rigorous decentralization, credible neutrality (so even if nation states are at war they will still be able to enter into smart contract-based deals with one another -- including treaties -- and back their word with large stake), censorship resistance, developer base, massive transaction throughput, low latency, and universal composability.

Just as information, goodwill and promises (i.e. agreements or assurances) can be considered intangible commodities, we can can consider the trust that ETH and Ethereum confer to applications, processes and storage of assets to be a commodity.  There is no stronger form of the trust commodity on the planet than what a rigorously decentralized smart contract platform can provide to a wide variety of use cases.

As we build valuation models for ETH and the Ethereum network and the extended ecosystem, we should consider multiple component models.  Eventually DCF will grow in importance in the composite model, but I think viewing ETH as the purest and hardest trust diamond on the planet is more powerful and more accurate.  Ethereum is the gold standard in trust.  ETH is highest octane trust because it preserves or adds so much value to various use cases.  It is due to this characteristic that ETH will earn a very large monetary premium over what might be suggested via DCF or mimetic valuation components.",193.0,False,-1.0,-1

It's not just for those with diagnosed conditions - everyone can benefit from better brain function.

Safety is a top priority and a large advantage of ultrasound. It has been used for decades for sensitive applications like imaging children in the womb in addition to being studied directly for neuromodulation at similar low power levels.

I‚Äôm not surprised. Just annoyed, disappointed, and ready to fight. 

I am confident that the products we offer are legal and that our work is on the right side of history. But it‚Äôs been clear for a while that rather than working to create clear, informed rules, the SEC has decided to focus on attacking long-time good actors like Uniswap and Coinbase. All while letting bad actors like FTX slip by.

When I first set out to build Uniswap, the goal wasn‚Äôt to reimagine finance.

It was an experiment in radically decentralized, fully automated onchain markets. I didn‚Äôt know if it would work or if anyone would use it.

Fast forward to today, the Uniswap Protocol has processed over $2 trillion in volume. Many thousands of teams and developers have forked our code or built on top of it. We built entirely new financial infrastructure that is transparent, fair, secure, and accessible powering an entire industry.

The team at @Uniswap did all of this in the US from our office in New York City.

People often ask me why we stay in the US and my answer is simple: I believe that blockchain is incredibly powerful technology. Like the Internet, it‚Äôs here to stay. So someone needs to figure it out, and it might as well be us.

And that when you build technology that improves people‚Äôs lives ‚Äì you don‚Äôt need to hide. 

The @SEC‚Äôs mission is ‚Äúprotecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.‚Äù This is a noble mission. I would argue @Uniswap does a far better job of this today than the SEC.

Yes, I'm frustrated that the SEC seems to be more concerned with protecting opaque systems than protecting consumers. And that we'll have to fight a US government agency to protect our company and our industry.

This fight will take years, may go all the way to the Supreme Court, and the future of financial technology and our industry hangs in the balance. If we stand together we can win. 

I think freedom is worth fighting for. I think DeFi is worth fighting for.

And of course, we won‚Äôt stop shipping. Stay tuned

1) tokens, not points

2) don‚Äôt farm the farmers - teasing and creating ambiguity around a token distribution to grow your numbers is bad behavior. If you don‚Äôt know yet, don‚Äôt speculate publicly. If you do know but are not ready to share full details, don‚Äôt tease them out. Just share real details when ready

3) real liquidity day 1 - low float tokens are malicious and my biggest pet peeve. You don‚Äôt need to work with exchanges or market makers. It‚Äôs so easy. Just distribute enough tokens publicly that real price discovery happens on DEX. People should start thinking in FDV not mcap when valuing these things 

4) don‚Äôt create absurdly high token supply to farm people with unit bias, this is also bad behavior 

5) don‚Äôt be stingy - give a significant amount away. If you don‚Äôt think the community deserves a significant amount, don‚Äôt release a token

6) don‚Äôt market token price - if you tweet about how your token is going to moon or hire influencers, or marketing firms to do so I assume you‚Äôre just trying to get rich quick vs build real value

7) keep it simple 

8) put real thought and care into your decisions - so you can stand behind them and explain your rationale. Don‚Äôt end up in a situation where you‚Äôre fighting or apologizing to crypto twitter. Create something you‚Äôre proud of and stand behind it",1917.0,False,-1.0,-1

Throughout Uniswap's history, there have been many moments that upset people

Raising VC funding, adding fee switch to v2, not having a token, having a token, criticizing Nomi days before he rugged, blocking certain tokens in the UI, geoblocking OFAC countries, concentrated liquidity, BUSL, etc

Some people wish instead of raising money to build at scale, I begged for grants until I ran out of money and gave up

Some people wish I moved abroad and launched a token anon, and had to look over my shoulder the rest of my life

Some people want me to practice civil disobedience, intentionally flaunting laws they (and often I) believe are unjust and live with the legal consequences

Some people disagree with structural, economic, or technical decisions that were made

I work in crypto because of the immense positive impact I believe it can have on the world by removing gatekeepers, and increasing access to value and ownership, the same way the internet has for information

I work on Uniswap because I think it has massive potential to contribute to that outcome

I'm incredibly proud of Uniswap v1, v2, v3, v4, the thousands of projects building on top of it, the web app with millions of users, the wallet with hundreds of thousands of downloads, and the airdrop that changes thousands of lives around the world

I've made many mistakes, but stand behind the decisions I've made. I'm a bit introverted, so constant public communication can be tough. But I'm going to continue pushing myself to engage publicly, transparently, and clearly as often as I'm able.

We're still in the early days  - this technology and revolution will play out over decades. I'm in it for the long haul - that's why I'm still grinding away 5 years in

Hope that we can come together more as an industry, and see past minor disagreements

@Uniswap Labs is not a broker. The Uniswap Protocol is not an unregistered exchange or clearing agency or operated by Labs. UNI is not a security.

They went after us despite having no clear legal basis, as part of a strategy of arbitrary enforcement to try to force DeFi into a regulatory framework that doesn‚Äôt fit‚Äîall while refusing to provide clear rules or a path to compliance.

This investigation took over 3 years, forcing us to waste incredible amounts of time and millions of dollars. It also had a personal impact ‚Äî federal investigations are violating and stressful to the point where there is a saying among lawyers that ‚Äúthe investigation IS the punishment.‚Äù That shouldn‚Äôt be the price of innovation in the US.

This is a huge win, not just for Uniswap Labs but for DeFi as a whole. It reaffirms what we‚Äôve said all along: that decentralized technology and self-custody are inherently different from the centralized, intermediated systems they aim to replace.

Self-custodied funds, with self-executing code run on public blockchains, are a huge step forward in transparency for financial markets. Slapping regulations aimed at centralized, opaque TradFi markets on top of DeFi simply does not work.

I‚Äôm grateful that the new SEC leadership is taking a more constructive approach, and I look forward to working with Congress and regulators to help create rules that actually make sense for DeFi ‚Äì encouraging innovation, improving transparency and access to financial markets, and ensuring that this technology can thrive in the US, instead of being pushed offshore.

I‚Äôm proud of the ways @Uniswap Labs has contributed to that effort and want to make sure we‚Äôre creating sustainable systems to power this work. From day one, we‚Äôve worked to be both a transparent and sustainable business.

As a next step, starting tomorrow we will charge a 0.15% swap fee ‚Äì the first in Labs‚Äô history ‚Äì on certain tokens in our web app and wallet. The list of tokens and fee level will be kept updated in our help center linked below.

This is separate from the Uniswap Protocol fee switch, which is voted on by UNI token governance.

I built the protocol to be a permissionless and decentralized public good. Users have countless choices of ways to use it, through aggregators, other UIs, or by interacting directly with the smart contracts. Imo our interface remains the best ‚Äì a huge amount of love (and money) goes into making that the case :)

This interface fee is one of the lowest in the industry, and it will allow us to continue to research, develop, build, ship, improve, and expand crypto and DeFi.

The end goal is a agenda based CBDC partnered with a handful of massive banks and end-to-end control over every aspect of your financial life. 

A regulatory event is where you have a debate about compliance with a law or guidance. This event seems to be a  polticial philosophical disagreement with the very existence of cryptocurrencies and what they represent. An unelected group of people have decided that concepts like self-sovereign identity, owning your wallet, and the freedom to control your economic agency should be removed from the masses and given to the ""enlightened"" few. 

Honestly, what is happening isn't anything new. It's always the same fight between freedom and authoritarianism just with different players, technology, and words. It does seem like this event is a perfect opportunity for the entire industry to set aside it's fragmented nature and unite for a common sense set of rules and guidelines that can prevent the United States from slipping into a distopia that would make 1984 look like a vacation.

- I saw a lot of politicians on this call, and a few industry people (mostly legal), and I didn‚Äôt listen to the whole event, but I didn‚Äôt see ANYONE resembling the crypto company founders of the 100+ companies we have in our portfolio at @coinfund_io. I also appreciate @mcuban‚Äôs work to help crypto, but I didn‚Äôt see anyone representing actual crypto-focused investors (people who focus their entire day and fund and last x>>5 years on this industry). Investors and founders: the bread and butter of any industry. In short, it satisfied the ‚ÄúHarris‚Äù prong but not the ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù prong in @Crypto4Harris as far as I see it. 

- I heard some pleasantries spoken. Things like ‚Äúwe must level the playing field of crypto‚Äù. It was a bit offensive, actually. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech have done more to level the playing field of economic opportunities for people than the dems, *in spite* of their policy, and certainly in the period of time that Ms. Harris has been in office while the policy has been extra hostile. DM me, I have receipts; I‚Äôm happy to tell you the stories.

- On that note, no one really mentioned the unmitigated disaster to law-abiding entrepreneurs that has been SEC policy this period. No one mentioned the veto, despite @chuckschumer opening the discussion. Or the lack of clarity. Or failures like FTX. Or Chokepoint. Or the overall obvious and still-reverberating failure of the US to support innovation under the current Harris administration.

Bitcoin has around 106m users, 750k DAUs, and 30m MAUs. Today @worldcoin has 26m users, 1.7m DAUs, and 8m MAUs.

World is already exceeding Bitcoin DAUs by 2x+. Bitcoiners tend to hodl, while World users have an entire web3 app store of games, payments, and DeFi to create transactions on. We need a 4x on MAUs. 

World has converted ~11m scans on <1K devices in 2 years. The number of devices is now going to 10x and probably 20x with Orb Mini, not to mention flagship stores and Razer locations.

Even assuming MAUs stay proportional to registered (network effects could increase this ratio), we just need 100m registered users. 

World app has already converted ~1M users PER DAY at peak, with roughly half of users getting a scan. So we just need 148 days of peak *scanning* to get to 100m *registered* ‚Äî but the reality is registered will be twice that. 

Mass scans will have to ramp up over time as devices get distributed, and there are various risks and potential delays of course, but box that in by doubling the runway. On a two year timeframe frame that seems totally doable.

This got me thinking of blockchain architectures, and what happens in the future when blockchain demand becomes more seasonal in some ways and sees spikes the way Amazon did.

IMHO Stellar is the most underrated and least understood crypto project. A lot of recent attention but people are still sleeping on this network.

Stellar already does way more transactions per day than all but two networks. 10x the number of transactions per day than Ethereum. Many real people are already using it for actual real-world transactions.

So many things are just simpler and well thought out. Native stablecoin and token issuing. Builtin DEX. On chain governance. Smart contract system that is safer (no footguns like re-entrancy), more performant (built from the ground up for concurrency), more sustainable (state archival).  Better foundation for actually good UX (passkey support, native multi-sig), etc

It has been one of the most performant chains for years. Its fees have always been essentially 0 because the protocol is efficient and fast.

This is more qualitative, but the engineering is world class. And not so sexy but look at the developer docs. Absolutely the best in the industry.  Makes spinning up on stellar as a developer a delight.

I believe the best and most impactful use of crypto is as digital money. Which means it must be a good and useful means of payment. This is what Stellar has been focused on and what it is built for. And it is a very very good system for this. People and businesses around the world are realizing this and I think Stellar has a very real chance of becoming a big part of the world's financial infrastructure.

I‚Äôm also excited to share that Binance will adopt USDC as a vital dollar stablecoin for their own corporate treasury, demonstrating that one of the most sophisticated onchain treasury operations is putting their full faith behind USDC as a digital dollar for storing and moving value.

Through our collaboration, Circle will provide Binance with a range of technology, liquidity and other tools for Binance users to benefit from the trust and innovation that Circle has built for USDC.

We will also be coming together to work on products and partnerships that advance the use of stablecoins and crypto infrastructure in everyday finance and commerce all around the world.

I have long admired Binance for their relentless commitment to product quality, innovation and user-centricity, which shows in their massive and loyal global community of more than 240M users.¬† As a comprehensive service that spans investing, trading, saving, storing and payments, Binance is truly one of the world‚Äôs largest and most open financial superapp‚Äôs in the world.¬† And I look forward to being a close partner as they scale to 1B+ users in the coming years.

As Binance itself becomes one of the most widely regulated global exchanges, and continues to invest in robust compliance and risk management infrastructure, the marriage of the largest and fastest growing compliant stablecoin with their global platform marks a major and material shift in the emerging crypto market structure as we enter 2025.

There will be much to come from this partnership spanning products and how we bring our combined capabilities to the market. We look forward to sharing it all with you in the weeks, months and years ahead!

5975,jerallaire,156887.0,2024/06/19 10:21:45,"I‚Äôm more bullish than I have ever been about crypto.

I have been building @Circle for over 11 years, and at no time have I been more optimistic than right now.

I also believe that the overwhelming majority of people have an extremely narrow and limited understanding of what‚Äôs unfolding.  And that‚Äôs super bullish too.

This post explains why I am so optimistic.

My perspective here draws on closely watching internet technology adoption life cycles over the past ~35 years.  We‚Äôve seen an unrelenting march of open networks, open protocols and open software, with layer upon layer of infrastructure on the internet that deepens its utility for society and the economy.  Each successive wave has transformed major industries, improving utility for people, inverting or transforming unit economics, and opening up radical new possibilities.

The collective contribution of open IP to this ongoing internet revolution actually appears to be accelerating, and crypto seems like it's on the cusp of catapulting society and the economy forward in tremendously powerful new ways.

11+ years ago when Sean and I were thinking about this space, it was totally apparent that crypto represented the next logical layer of infrastructure for the internet.  Internet infrastructure had enabled frictionless, nearly free movement of data and seamless ability to connect and deploy software and hardware on a global network, and it was clearly struggling with its own success and weight.

The internet lacked a layer for trust, and without that it was capped in terms of the utility it could provide to the world.  There was no way to have fully trusted data, transactions or compute, which led to deepening dependencies on hyper centralized entities (corporate and government).

At the same time, the role of the internet in society was proliferating, and the ability of the internet to play a larger and larger role in how society and the economy were organized was apparent.

And it was right at this moment that Bitcoin burst onto the scene, and a ton of incredibly sharp technologists began to think more deeply about how the fundamentals of crypto could be expanded to provide a more generalized internet infrastructure that could be foundational to society and the economy.  Digital tokens, issued on public blockchains, intermediated by smart contracts could unleash a trusted environment on a global scale that would be the foundation of how nearly all of the building blocks of society and the economy could become internet-native.

This is what drew me into this space; I could see clearly then that this would unfold, that these new decentralized internet computers would achieve scale, and that it would ultimately usher in a wave of change that far exceeds the kinds of changes we‚Äôve seen from the internet of information and communications.

In 2013, these ideas were considered insane.  Any affiliation with Bitcoin or crypto was viewed as highly fringe, probably illegal, and for most technologists, a largely uninteresting technology development.  Back then, the technology was extremely limited, slow, expensive, complex to operate.

Fiduciary institutions ‚Äì banks, accounting and audit firms, insurance companies, regulators ‚Äì were extremely hostile and deeply terrified to be associated with anything in this space.

The primary focus of the media was on darknet markets, the silk road, and the winklevoss twins BTC purchases.

But if you actually paid attention to what mostly young and highly creative builders were thinking about and doing, you could see clearly that the bigger vision was going to unfold, though over what exact time-scale it was not clear.

For those of us who have been building and working in this space since 2012 (and many from even earlier!), it‚Äôs totally and utterly extraordinary where we are at now.  And, as I like to say often, we are truly only in the very early stages of the adoption of crypto in the world, which makes me insanely bullish today, given how far we‚Äôve come in the past decade.

How far have we come? A non-exhaustive list of accomplishments and technical progress.

Public blockchain infrastructure has evolved into its 3rd generation, providing global scale network computers that can handle large scale applications with trusted data, transactions and compute.

There is a massive, thriving and growing competitive and innovative community of dozens of major blockchain network ecosystems, all around the world, that are constantly improving and innovating in the fundamental technology of these networks including in data availability, compute, security, privacy, transaction throughput, and so much more.

We are at the early broadband stage of blockchain networks.  Guess what comes next?

We are seeing breakthroughs in security, privacy and scalability based on ZK tech, and now FHE.  We can see a world where crypto computing becomes the basis for most significant and important applications.

There are literally tens of thousands of startups all around the world building on top of this infrastructure.

Digital assets have become an accepted part of the emerging global financial system, with virtually every major government in the world setting clear rules for how digital assets can be issued, used and traded.

Bitcoin itself has become one of the largest and most important alternative investment assets on the planet.

The biggest asset management firms in the world are offering products and services built on blockchain technology and offering investments into the underlying digital commodities.

Crypto has become a global political issue, as its importance to national competitiveness becomes clear.  Governments around the world are racing to compete with one another to figure this out and ensure that innovation in this space is both responsible but also fostered.

We‚Äôre seeing product UX that unlocks consumer-scale usage in ways we‚Äôve not seen before, giving a clearer view of how this will unfold for billions of users in the coming years.

Most of the world's largest payments companies are actively using this technology and exploring how to expand their usage as the benefits of public chains and stablecoins become apparent to everyone.

Stablecoins have exploded in scale and use, crypto clearest killer app, unleashing digital dollars in the world, bringing more people into the future onchain economy, and starting to fulfill the promise of banking the unbanked, lower the costs of remittances, and unlocking more seamless cross-border commerce.

Stablecoins are becoming a legally defined and accepted form of digital money in nearly every major jurisdiction in the world.  By the end of 2025, stablecoins will be ‚Äúlegal electronic money‚Äù almost everywhere, which sets them up to become a larger and larger portion of the $100T+ market for electronic money.

The infrastructure to build, deploy and operate blockchain apps has advanced massively, with enterprise-grade products and services to help use these networks, with custody infrastructure that scales for end-user controlled self-custody to infrastructure that the world‚Äôs largest banks and asset managers can depend on.

Developer tooling, SDKs, and knowledge are proliferating at an accelerating pace.  More and more people are becoming ‚Äúblockchain capable‚Äù.

Massive consumer scale companies are bringing online apps that connect to public chains and use digital tokens for a wide array of use cases.

National governments are investing in blockchain infrastructure, ecosystem development and passing laws to provide incentives to companies to build in their regions.

We‚Äôre seeing more and more exciting uses of the tech gaining traction every week, from payments to social to gaming to ticketing to enterprise use-cases.

I could go on and on and on, but the scale of all of this right now is truly astounding compared to where we were a decade ago.  Like prior waves of open internet infrastructure, this wave is growing, and is coming on stronger every day and every week.

And, like I said earlier, we‚Äôre still in the VERY EARLY STAGES in the adoption of crypto.  That‚Äôs insanely bullish.

What does this look like when digital tokens are a widely understood and legally used form of incentives, governance, and record-keeping all around the world?  

What does it look like when a larger and larger portion of finance and commerce constructs are executed and intermediated by smart contracts on public chain infrastructure?

What does it look like when 4th generation blockchain networks support billions of users and millions of applications?

What does it look like when onchain organizations are legally defined and explode and compete for organizing labor and capital and consistently outperform legacy multi-national corporations?

What does it look like when political bodies ‚Äì cities, states, nations, and new network states ‚Äì adopt onchain governance and improve how democratic values are expressed in the age of the internet?

What does it look like when 10% of global economic money is stablecoins, and when credit intermediation moves from fractional reserve lending to onchain credit markets built from the ground up on safer, digital cash instruments (e.g. stables), and opens up credit and debt to the long tail of supply and demand in the same way that Amazon did for commerce and AdWords did for advertising?

All of this is achievable over the next 10+ years.  The time goes by fast, but when you zoom out and look at what has been accomplished and how that sets us up for the future, it‚Äôs hard not to be insanely optimistic right now.

Circle is now natively issuing both USDC and EURC to European customers effective July 1st.

Details below‚Ä¶.

Today‚Äôs announcement from Circle is a major milestone in the ongoing development of the internet financial system, with one of the largest economies in the world having established clear regulations that make stablecoins legal electronic money, and ushering in a phase in the crypto market‚Äôs development as a mainstream infrastructure for payments, finance and commerce.

It‚Äôs incredibly gratifying to witness this moment in the evolution and adoption of digital currency.  Some 11 years ago when we started Circle, it was with a clear vision that blockchain networks would make it possible to issue fully-reserved fiat digital currency that could operate on open and interoperable public networks, enabling a transformation in value exchange similar to the transformation that open networks brought to information publishing and communications.

At that time, we knew if we were to succeed in realizing our vision two things needed to happen: first, blockchain tech needed to evolve massively (e.g. we needed chains where you could issue tokens, execute code in the form of smart contracts, build actual money protocols on blockchains, and scalable infrastructure); and second, new policies and laws would need to be established, likely globally, for how what we think of as money (e.g. cash, government bonds, HQLAs) could connect to this new kind of open, programmable public network infrastructure.

Circle was the first crypto company to receive Electronic Money Transmission Licenses throughout the US, the first crypto company to receive a New York BitLicense, the first crypto company to receive an E-Money Issuance license in the UK, and we pioneered early models for how fiat could work on public chains (initially over Bitcoin).

Back then all of this was considered incredibly niche, the mainstream financial sector was hostile to all of it, and the entire concept of fiat digital currency did not really even exist outside of very early crypto circles.  The concept of seeing major global laws that enshrined stablecoins into the financial system was inconceivable.

Then, six years ago, in 2018, the technology of Ethereum made building a ‚Äúprotocol for dollars on the internet‚Äù or an ‚ÄúHTTP for Money‚Äù a real possibility, and in May of 2018 we announced, and then later launched USDC, a protocol for dollars on the internet.  Working with payments regulators throughout the US, we brought this innovation in electronic money onto public blockchains with a protocol that developers could build on, automate and integrate into smart contract applications. With nearly immediate product market fit (the birth of DeFi, and the rapid growth of stablecoins on digital asset exchanges), this whole category began to grow, albeit from a tiny base of usage.

Shortly after our launch of USDC, the world‚Äôs largest internet company by end-users, Facebook, announced their intention to enter the global stablecoin market with Project Libra, a synthetic global currency they intended to launch to their 3 billion user customer base.  Facing nearly immediate and hostile backlash from governments around the world, the project came under intense scrutiny, and spawned an effort first at the G7 and then through the G20 and the Financial Stability Board to develop a global regulatory approach to stablecoins.

Not long after, just 4 years ago, two major developments occurred:

First, the work of the global regulatory community culminated in a set of G20 Policy Recommendations for stablecoins, which were later ratified at the G20 and sent on to member countries to bring into law through their policy and regulatory apparatus‚Äô.

Second, the bottoms-up, open internet and open ecosystem innovations like USDC surged in growth alongside explosive growth and interest in blockchains and crypto assets.  USDC grew 1000% two years straight, from 400M to 4B to 40B, and the infrastructure around crypto matured rapidly as well, with the advent of 3rd generation blockchains and the rise of onchain finance and payments.

Major governments (the US, EU, Singapore, Japan, and many others) began to move more swiftly on the policy front, with leadership in the EU and US both pushing for the rapid introduction of regulations for stablecoins and crypto asset markets.

Then, nearly 2 years ago to this day, the EU institutions reached a deal on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regime, which was finally approved by the EU Parliament‚Äôs plenary - and also entered into force - last year. MiCA sets forth the world‚Äôs most comprehensive regulations for stablecoins and digital asset markets.

And, on that same day as MiCA being agreed on, Circle announced our initial launch of a Euro Stablecoin, along with a statement of our full intention to bring our stablecoins into compliance with these new and critical regulations for the European Union.

As many people know, France was - and continues to be - at the forefront of establishing clear regulations around crypto and digital assets, with early French laws regulating crypto trading firms, crypto custody and rules for issuing and selling digital tokens.  The French government took a leading role not just in France, but ultimately, under the French Presidency of the EU - they helped to usher in an EU-wide regulatory framework that in many ways was inspired by earlier innovation-forward French policies.

Circle determined quickly that we should choose France as our new European headquarters for launching our regulated stablecoin and digital asset businesses.  That choice has proven wise ‚Äì we have been able to work extremely hard over the past two years with the ACPR to bring Circle‚Äôs business into the EU and under the new comprehensive regulatory regime of MiCA.

Our Announcement

Today, I am delighted to share that Circle is authorized as an E-Money Issuer by the ACPR in France, and a MiCA-compliant E-Money Token issuer for both USDC and EURC.

Circle France is now home to the headquarters of our European regulated financial activity, and European customers can now directly access USDC and EURC via Circle Mint France.

USDC has become the first and only major global stablecoin to be compliant and available under the new stablecoin regulatory regime in Europe.

We have worked intensively with French, EU and US prudential regulators to clarify how a global stablecoin such as USDC can be issued out of BOTH the US and Europe, while maintaining complete fungibility on blockchain networks. This is a major breakthrough and reflects creativity, hard work and a spirit of trying to both embrace a major technical innovation (fungible, globally available digital currency) while meeting stringent and important regulatory standards to ensure the safety and soundness of these electronic money tokens for persons across different regimes.

What does this mean for customers today?

All USDC and EURC currently in circulation in Europe are officially MiCA compliant, with Circle now holding 100% of EURC reserves under our regulated Circle France entity, and similarly holding the necessary reserves for European USDC holders within the EU with a Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB).

All of the USDC held by Europeans remains fully fungible globally, and users can trade, transact, self-custody, use in DeFi, etc. with no changes.  For the vast majority of European users who purchase, hold or sell USDC or EURC on an exchange or other crypto asset service provider‚Äôs product, nothing changes.

Effectively immediately, Circle is now issuing and redeeming USDC and EURC directly with major institutions in the European market via Circle Mint France. This includes exchanges, market makers, brokerages, consumer wallets, fintechs and payment institutions, banks and large enterprises.

Alongside our launch, you will begin to see a series of announcements from the entire global digital asset ecosystem who are adopting USDC and EURC as the preferred regulated stablecoins on their platforms and services, as Circle is the only global issuer who is able to provide these stablecoins in a fully compliant manner.

What is changing, of course, is that Circle‚Äôs stablecoins are now under the direct supervision of prudential regulators in Europe, namely the ACPR here in France, following detailed prudential standards, the so-called MiCA level two legislation, developed by the European Banking Authority.  European users are afforded the protections brought from MiCA, ensuring safe and sound reserves, fully audited financial statements, prudential risk management, strict compliance with financial crimes and anti-money laundering rules, and detailed public reporting.

Impact on the Global and European Digital Assets Market

For nearly a year, and with increasing intensity over the past months, the global digital asset industry has been scrambling to understand the impact of MiCA, the world‚Äôs first and most comprehensive crypto regulatory regime that ultimately spans a market with nearly 450 million customers.

With stablecoins, especially dollar stablecoins, becoming the bedrock of digital asset markets, major global exchanges and crypto asset services providers (CASPs) with European customers, as well as 100% of European-based CASPs, have been highly focused on how the market will unfold and whether any major dollar stablecoin would be able to continue functioning with this new comprehensive regulatory regime.

That question has now been decisively answered, and the world‚Äôs leading, regulated digital dollar, USDC, is now available in the EU, and we hope and expect it will become the leading dollar stablecoin in the region.

However, this moment portends a much broader market structure shift that we believe is going to accelerate over the next year, as major jurisdictions ranging from Japan, the US, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE, Brazil, and many other major markets and economies also go live with comprehensive stablecoin rules, all of which require stringent regulatory compliance, and where dollar stablecoins in particular must be issued under a burden of regulatory equivalence. Circle has built the infrastructure necessary to deliver USDC as a fungible digital dollar that can meet the emerging regulatory requirements of diverse global jurisdictions.

It is during moments such as this that the entire global digital asset industry should be reflecting on what their future looks like, what the expectations for responsible innovation entail, and work towards operating products and services built on the strongest foundation possible.

Impact on the Adoption of Euro Stablecoins and Stablecoins More Broadly

One of the most significant and exciting things that this moment entails is the almost certain growth in and adoption of Euro digital currency in the form of Euro stablecoins. By establishing a clear rulebook for the issuance and operations of Euro digital currency, these new laws will foster a highly competitive market for Euro digital currency, with banks and EMIs both able to issue and utilize Euro stablecoins as a core part of their products and services.

This means that the entire European regulated financial sector can now adopt blockchain-native financial infrastructure, which will significantly expand the utility of stablecoins in commerce and finance. We are already seeing significant and accelerating interest in EURC from major enterprises, large financial institutions, payments firms and others who now see the opportunity to leverage blockchain technology and Web3 to power new forms of programmable finance and commerce.

In this case, clear and comprehensive regulation will absolutely serve the dual purpose of protecting customers and the market, while also creating a clear set of rules of the road that will foster mainstream adoption.

It is this fact that should be widely greeted with enthusiasm and celebrated around the world as a turning point in the development of the internet financial system.

July 1st, 2024 will be remembered as a major moment in the development of this new internet financial system. It marks the end of the beginning stages of digital assets, and the start of the mainstream growth and adoption phase. Europe should be proud at this moment, as should France, which has driven and led policy and regulation in this area for years, and is working to attract leading global firms such as Circle to call France our European home.

5980,jerallaire,156887.0,2024/09/13 10:29:09,"BREAKING NEWS:  @circle has announced that we are moving our Global HQ to New York City, building out a flagship space on one of the top floors of 1 World Trade Center, an historically important landmark in standing for American global economic leadership. Details below the video.

I‚Äôm thrilled to celebrate this milestone with an event including leading financial industry firms, crypto industry leaders and policymakers.  We are also sharing this announcement video that captures the moment and inspiration.

Why is this important for Crypto, Circle, New York, America and the US Dollar?

Since our founding, we have envisioned building a new internet financial system on the foundations of crypto ‚Äì open networks, open source software, open protocols, decentralized and distributed infrastructure ‚Äì and building on and expanding the capabilities of the largest and most important currencies in the world, starting with the US dollar.

11 years into our founding, that vision is coming alive in a tremendous and exciting way, with USDC now powering trillions of dollars of onchain transactions, with thousands of developers and applications building on this innovation, and with increasing legal clarity that digital dollars like USDC are new forms of legal electronic money that can be used widely around the world.

As this technology explodes into the mainstream, and as Circle becomes a more and more important company and infrastructure for this new internet financial system, it became clear that we needed to plant our flag, both literally and figuratively, in the heart of Wall Street, in the most important economic center of the world, and in the great country of the United States of America.

Many complain that the United States is not the right jurisdiction to build a company in our industry, and that the current government here remains hostile to this industry.  I couldn‚Äôt disagree more.  My view is that we are at a turning point, and that the US is about to become THE decisive leader in building and supporting this technology and financial revolution.

We are an American Technology champion, and we want to demonstrate that the highest quality, the best run, the safest and the most powerful technology for the new internet financial system calls not just the US, but New York City, it‚Äôs home.

Today, New York City is home to an enormous number of crypto firms that are leading and innovating in nearly every area of this industry.  New York may have the most talent-density in crypto of any city in the world.  It‚Äôs truly astounding, and we feel so privileged to join this thriving community of companies with a flagship headquarters in New York.

After having originally founded the company in Boston, like many technology-driven companies, we have scaled out largely as a remote-first operation. Today, we span 36 US states and 14 countries, with a presence in many of the world‚Äôs leading cities including New York, SF Bay Area, Boston, London, Dublin, Paris, Singapore, Berlin, S√£o Paulo, Taipei and more.  And we are growing all around the world.  But through this, New York has become a crucial nexus of talent, connectivity and a core location for where we convene.

1 World Trade Center is an awe-inspiring building.  Its history is known to nearly everyone; this iconic tower, the tallest in the Western hemisphere, stands for freedom, strength, and a projection of America‚Äôs central role in the global economic system.  Freedom Tower stands above the great pillars of the global economic system ‚Äì Wall St., the New York Stock Exchange, the New York Federal Reserve, and more.

Sitting on a top floor of the tower, Circle‚Äôs new flagship HQ is being built not as a traditional office, but rather as a powerful convening space, where we bring together all of our stakeholders to collaborate together, discover, and build the new internet financial system.  It‚Äôs going to be an amazing and inspiring space that helps bring to life everything that we do at Circle.

Today, we are celebrating this new HQ, joined in person in New York by industry, political and key partners who have been central to Circle‚Äôs growth and success.  Join us virtually in this next phase of our journey.

We are investing in New York.  We are investing in America.  We believe strongly that the infrastructure we are collectively building ‚Äì this new internet financial system ‚Äì will be the foundation for the next hundred years of global economic activity and coordination.

2024 has been a turning point year in crypto, a year when stablecoins started to truly breakout in scale, importance and usage.  2025 will be the year when this goes mainstream.  As we open our new HQ to the world in early 2025, we will be thrilled to host and convene and see many of you there for this next phase of our collective journey in building a more open, inclusive, safer and efficient global economic system.

Why is this such a big deal?

In June of this year, the Japanese government laid out a vision for growing the Web3 industry in Japan, and crucially, put into effect new stablecoin laws for both domestic and foreign-issued stablecoins.  Japan is the first major government in the world with this regulatory clarity in effect.  Stablecoins that cannot meet the high-standards set out by the JFSA will not be allowed to circulate on Japanese markets.

These changes have dramatically opened up the opportunities for stablecoins and Web3 in the world‚Äôs 4th largest economy.  The opportunity for Circle and USDC is significant.

To seize the opportunity, I am incredibly excited to be working with Chairman of SBI Holdings, Mr. Kitao-san, who is an extraordinary businessman, innovator and leader in Asia and the world.  SBI Holdings operates one of the largest financial conglomerates in Japan, with the largest online retail brokerage, one of the largest digital banks, one of the largest retail FX platforms, a trust bank and more.

Importantly, Kitao-san is not a ‚Äújohnny come lately‚Äù to crypto and blockchain tech.  He has understood it and invested in it for nearly a decade.  SBI Holdings already operates digital asset trading, brokerage and cross-border payments solutions.

Kitao-san and I have a shared vision for what the new internet financial system will look like and the impact it will have on commerce, trade and innovation.

What does the partnership exactly look like?

Our highest priority together is to bring USDC into the Japan market, in a regulated capacity, following the new JFSA stablecoin laws.  As we have done throughout our history, we will work arm and arm with our partners and local regulators.

Once launched, USDC can become a stablecoin on Japan digital asset markets, and can be widely used in the on-chain economy growing in Japan as well, across many consumer-led Web3 product categories.  We can also work with the very large established retail and crypto platforms that SBI Group operates to adopt USDC as a new digital dollar.

The dollar plays a crucial role in cross-border payments, FX and trading in the Japan market.  This will extend into the adoption of digital dollars used on blockchain networks.

Another part of this is bringing direct banking from Japan to Circle‚Äôs USDC treasury and settlement operations, which translates to direct and local liquidity between JPY and USDC via the domestic banking system in Japan, building on the recent launch of the same in Singapore, with many more markets coming online soon.

Web3 Apps in Japan

We have also seen rapid growth in major consumer-facing companies in Japan looking to launch Web3 apps using digital tokens, smart contracts and self-custody digital wallets. To that end, Circle will also work with SBI to promote the growth and adoption of Circle‚Äôs full-stack Web3 Services suite, which provides and end-to-end development, deployment and operations platform for building and operating Web3 apps across chains.  Think games, culture and consumer entertainment.

A General Comment on Regulatory Clarity

What you‚Äôre seeing here are the fruits of major governments who have established regulatory clarity for stablecoins.  Good actors, working together, across the traditional and the new internet financial system to advance innovation with strong safeguards and supervision.

As this plays out around the world, expect to see many many more major partnerships with established Web2 companies and financial institutions who will make the leap into building and operating in the internet financial system.",443.0,False,-1.0,-1

¬†1) We have acquired Hashnote, issuer of the world‚Äôs largest Tokenized Money Market Fund (USYC);¬†

2) we have entered into a strategic partnership with global trading firm DRW to drive USDC and USDY in¬† crypto and TradFi markets; and¬†

3) we have announced our plans to launch USDC, alongside USYC, on the Canton blockchain network.

https://t.co/hJf463tdkP

Let me break all of this down.

First, we are thrilled to bring the Hashnote team and family into Circle.¬† As one of the leading pioneers of tokenization (USDC is arguably the largest form of regulated tokenized cash in the world), we have seen a rapid shift towards tokenized treasury assets through TMMFs.¬† There is an enormous and immediate opportunity to bring yield-bearing collateral into crypto market structures, and through seamless integration with USDC, enable market participants to convert between USDC and USYC on a 24/7/365 basis.¬† Hashnote has been a pioneer and is the largest issuer of TMMFs in the world today.

As more and more institutions get involved in the digital asset market, we are taking what are common practices in traditional finance and importing those onchain, but with the incredible super powers of global, real-time settlement, programmability and composability.¬† Indeed, one of the holy grails of capital markets is the ability to move between cash and collateral instantly.¬† We are unlocking this with a focus on the well established crypto capital markets.

With DRW, we are expanding on an already strong and nearly 10 year working relationship with DRW subsidiary Cumberland.¬† Don Wilson is a true visionary in markets, and Cumberland continues to be one of the largest and most important global trading firms in crypto.¬† Through this expanded partnership, Cumberland will expand its liquidity and settlement services for USDC and USYC, driving broader institutional adoption in crypto.¬† Additionally, we will work together to bring these onchain innovations into traditional financial markets, where tokenized cash and collateral can unlock enormous value for every financial market participant.

And on this note, Circle is also announcing its planned deployment of native USDC on Canton, the leading public blockchain for fully private and secure financial applications. With over $3.6 trillion in RWA issued and over $1.5 trillion repo/month, Canton is¬† already used and supported by major traditional banks, trading firms, asset managers and exchanges. With USYC already supported on Canton, offering native USDC integration will enable a seamless and 24/7/365 convertibility between collateral and cash for use in TradFi markets onchain.

TLDR ‚Äì Circle is leading the way in bringing the most important building blocks of money onchain, fostering a more scalable model of global institutional adoption of crypto infrastructure, while also paving the way for onchain money to become the core of traditional financial markets.

Stay tuned for a lot more on all of these fronts!

The promise of fully reserved digital dollars that can function with the speed and cost efficiency of the Internet has already been realized within digital asset markets, and now, because of increasing regulatory clarity, the same transformative technology is going to find its way into the very heart of the global financial system ‚Äì ‚Äì as cash, collateral and settlement infrastructure for the fastest moving markets in the world.

1) DyDX is one of the largest DeFi protocols in the world, and is likely to become more important not less as markets shift between CEX and DEX models for improved risk management and transparency.

2) CCTP will allow anyone on Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism and Cosmos (and soon Solana) to directly move USDC natively into DyDx without bridged or wrapped USDC.  Better, faster, cheaper, safer.

3) All of this is part of unlocking the next wave of usage on-chain, which requires safer, faster, cheaper and more user friendly ways to move value around. 

4) Lots of ecosystems coming together to make all of this work, spanning bridges, wallets, messaging layers, aggregators and of course blockchain networks.

Biden's supposed moral superiority has not translated to a winning strategy for the American people and our standards for the Executive in Chief must go beyond likability.

If the biggest criticism of @realDonaldTrump is that he's self-interested, we should welcome him. At least we know who we're working with. The man is sharp, savvy and capable enough to put this country on the right trajectory. In fact, he's already proven it once before. It's time for a return to merit.

Prior to my donation to Trump following Thursday night's debate, my last political contribution in a presidential race was to Obama in 2008. I believed that Obama could uniquely inspire and unite this country. Now, I believe Trump can do the same. A rising economic tide will lift all ships.

I know that some see this race as a choice between good and evil, and people will disagree about which side is which. If we take the emotion out of it, forget our MSM programming, and simply look at performance, the choice comes down to how you feel about these issues:
* Americans vs Big Pharma
* Americans vs illegal immigrants
* Americans vs foreign wars
* Americans vs big banks
* and on, and on...

If the purpose of the system is what it does -- if we are looking at outcomes -- we understand why there is so much opposition to the system being replaced. It's afraid. The American people are being manipulated, looted and pitted against each other for someone else's benefit. We don't know who is piloting the avatar known as Biden but it's safe to say they are either grossly incompetent or adversarial to America. Will the new system be better than the old system? We have good reason to believe it will be and any chance is better than certain demise. And no, I will not be fooled when the system predictably attempts to hot swap a new avatar.

As far as the crypto industry goes, the current administration continues to use every tool available to openly attempt murder on a daily basis so, of course, we will support the guy who at least claims he won't do that (and, btw, can give you all the philosophical, humanitarian, economic and national security reasons why it makes sense). Some see this as a ""sacrificing the world for shareholder value"" situation but it's the contrary. Crypto is, in many ways, the key to unlocking peace and prosperity in the world and it's why many in crypto are single issue voters.

In closing, I challenge the Trump detractors to seriously think about the origin of those feelings as you smell your own farts. Do you really believe Trump is going to destroy the world? How? Why? Set aside your political party. Do you really want what's best for the poor and disenfranchised, and for America?

With XRP overtaking SOL, above $2, and approaching a $120B market cap, allow me to reflect.

When I sued the SEC, people assumed I was a huge XRP holder. The truth is, when the @Ripple case was filed, 50% of my net worth was in BTC. Today, it‚Äôs 80%. I also had 4X more in ETH than XRP.  In sum, XRP was a very small investment. 

I sued the SEC b/c what it did was wrong. I‚Äôm not talking about Ripple. The SEC sues lots of companies. I‚Äôm talking about the absurd allegation that XRP itself was illegal, including if acquired by USERS of the XRPL or by people who‚Äôd never heard of @bgarlinghouse, @chrislarsensf or Ripple. 

There were people being paid in XRP. Companies like @Spend_The_Bits and @TapJets used XRP in business applications. There were XRP debit cards. Thousands of people 
opened a trust line with the XRPL just to send üí∞ to others in seconds and for a fraction of a penny.

FACTS:

In 2014, the @USGAO declared XRP a ‚Äúvirtual currency utilized in a decentralized payment protocol called Ripple.‚Äù

In 2015, FinCEN declared XRP a virtual currency and told Ripple it must comply with Banking laws. The SEC was provided the details of the settlement and never said a word.

On June 13, 2018, SEC enforcement lawyers ‚úçÔ∏è a report on whether XRP was a security under Howey. SEC lawyers DID NOT recommend enforcement.

@bgarlinghouse met with Hinman and Clayton multiple times and Garlinghosue complained that XRP and Ripple were living in purgatory b/c BTC and ETH were given clarity in Hinman‚Äôs speech but not XRP. Not once did they inform Ripple it was because XRP was a security.

In the 2019 FSOC Annual Report, signed by Clayton, XRP, along with BTC, ETH and LTC, were described as virtual currencies gaining in market share.

In January 2019, Coinbase met with the SEC, specifically regarding XRP, and notified the SEC that Coinbase had run XRP through its digital assets framework, and some of the best, most experienced securities lawyers in the world had determined XRP NOT a security. But Coinbase would defer to the SEC b/c Coinbase wanted to soon go public and wanted to make sure the SEC was in agreement over XRP. The SEC allowed Coinbase to list XRP in February 2019 and Coinbase began marketing the utility of XRP much more aggressively than Ripple had ever done. In 2019, if you opened up the Coinbase app, you saw the below page.üëá

In June 2019, @MoneyGram filed paperwork with the SEC disclosing MoneyGram would be using XRP in its cross border payments business. The SEC knew MoneyGram was selling XRP on Coinbase to the general public. Yet, did nothing.

Also, the U.K., Japan, Singapore, Switzerland and the UAE had declared XRP a non-security token.

Yet, despite the above, the SEC, on December 22, 2020, claimed ALL XRP were illegal. 

I sued the SEC b/c gross government overreach is gross government overreach even if it‚Äôs üÜö a company you don‚Äôt like. Many turned a blind eye b/c they didn‚Äôt like Ripple. To me, it‚Äôs like free speech. You have to protect the speech you don‚Äôt like. If you don‚Äôt, eventually the government may unjustly come after speech or a company you do support.

Plus, even if you‚Äôre not a fan of Ripple, when you learn the facts surrounding the filing of the Ripple case, it is impossible to credibly say that everything was on the up and up. In fact, it was down right shameful. Disagree? Read the Joe Grundfest letter that I had to threaten the SEC with a second FOIA lawsuit to acquire. üëá

Although I didn‚Äôt own much XRP at the time, when 75K XRP holders joined me and XRP plummeted, I bought more and more.

As a Senator, sitting on the Banking Committee, @ewarren violated her oath. Her job is to provide and engage in actual oversight of the @SECGov. 

Instead, she conspired with her close friend @GaryGensler, not only giving him the exact questions she would ask before a hearing, but also the suggested answers to those same questions. 

That isn‚Äôt oversight - it‚Äôs  fraudulent, coached testimony before Congress. She literally said that she didn‚Äôt want to place Gensler in a tough spot. Are you f‚Äôing kidding me? 

HER JOB is to place the Chairman of the SEC in a tough spot -  asking hard hitting or ‚Äútough‚Äù questions. 

Think about this: 

Elizabeth Warren is üíØ the single biggest critic of #Bitcoin and Crypto in the U.S. Congress. She sits on the Banking Committee overseeing the SEC. And yet, she hasn‚Äôt asked the SEC or Gensler about SBF‚Äôs multiple meetings with Gensler and the SEC. She hasn‚Äôt questioned why or how Gensler MISSED SBF‚Äôs Fraud, considering his up and close meetings with SBF. 

And why was Gensler meeting with SBF multiple times? 

Gensler wasn‚Äôt meeting with @brian_armstrong @iampaulgrewal and the @coinbase team - despite Coinbase begging for meetings and being the largest exchange in America and also a U.S. publicly traded company!

No. Instead, Gensler was meeting with the CEO of an OFF SHORE exchange in the Bahamas who turned out to be the Bernie Madoff of Crypto. In her job overseeing the SEC, why hasn‚Äôt Warren asked for those meeting notes like @PatrickMcHenry and the @FinancialCmte have?

Warren preaches against Crypto every chance she can, but doesn‚Äôt ask why Gensler missed @FTX_Official @CelsiusNetwork Luna/UST, etc.? Why not? She found time to help kill a couple banks that worked with Crypto companies. Why not focus on the source of the problem: actual fraud? 

Is she not asking certain questions because of her own ties to SBF‚Äôs parents? SBF‚Äôs father - Joe Bankman wrote Warren‚Äôs tax plan in 2016. We know without a doubt that he helped SBF create all those shell companies to avoid taxes. SBF‚Äôs Mother runs a PAC to help Democrats, like Warren, take get elected.

I have over 600 #XRP holders who live in Massachusetts and who are her constituents. We begged Warren‚Äôs office to inquire about the SEC and do her job. Not only would she not give us the time of day, her staff said ‚ÄúThe Senator is never going to help considering the SEC sued a couple billionaires‚Äù aka @chrislarsensf & @bgarlinghouse.

Recently, Jamie Dimon, CEO of the nation‚Äôs largest bank, @jpmorgan, testified, rather, I should say - ‚Äútesti-lied‚Äù - before the Senate Banking Committee, of which, Senator Warren is a member. 

I was waiting for @ewarren, a self-proclaimed fighter for consumers, small investors, and women, to show up and ask tough questions of Dimon and the banking industry, especially as it pertains to his bank, JP Morgan Chase.  I‚Äôm still waiting. 

For example: 

‚ÄúTo date, JPMorgan Chase has paid a total of $39.68 BILLION in fines to resolve enforcement actions including securities abuses, banking violations, investor protection violations and other offenses.‚Äù üëá

https://t.co/dV48EcHGeU

We‚Äôre talking about $40 Billion dollars for illicit financial activities - against ONE BANK!

When you add in @BankofAmerica, @WellsFargo , @DeutscheBank @HSBC, @GoldmanSachs, and others, the fraudulent conduct, including money laundering for terrorists, and drug cartels, is staggering. 

For example, HSBC Bank USA laundered $881 million for notorious drug cartels like the Sinaloa in Mexico and Norte del Valle in Colombia. üëá

https://t.co/d4arr8ENia

Yet, Senator Warren failed to ask a single question about any of this criminal activity. Instead, she asked questions solely related to her own political agenda - trying to ban the self-custody of #Bitcoin and other Crypto assets in the United States. 

Since she claims to be a fighter for women, I was also waiting for her to ask questions about how JP Morgan Chase financed Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs child sex trafficking operation. In fact, JP Morgan settled with the U.S. Virgin Islands for $75 million, over a lawsuit ‚Äúaccusing the nation‚Äôs largest bank of facilitating Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs sex-trafficking enterprise for 15 years.‚Äùüëá

https://t.co/9roFmfiyf9

JP Morgan also paid $290 million to ‚Äúsexual abuse victims of Jeffrey Epstein who claimed that the bank ignored warnings.‚Äù üëá

https://t.co/wYTreBzz46

Yet, Senator Warren focused all her questions on Crypto of all things. Why has she remained silent on all of this? Is it because her friends or donors were involved? Many high profile politicians and individuals have been known to visit Epstein‚Äôs island. Her silence has been deafening to the victims.

Another example of @ewarren‚Äôs SELECTIVE OUTRAGE:

We know how much she hates crypto. In fact, when she announced she was running for a third term, she said she was building an anti-crypto army. Yet, she hasn‚Äôt asked @GaryGensler, a career banker himself, about his private meetings with the biggest Crypto fraudster of all - @SBF_FTX. 

Is it once again, because her colleagues are involved? Gensler‚Äôs is a big time Democratic donor and operative. In the 2008 presidential campaign cycle, Gensler served as a senior advisor to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and later advised the Obama campaign. In May 2015, Gensler was named chief financial officer of Clinton's campaign for president. Also, Gensler‚Äôs daughters worked on Senator Warren‚Äôs campaign. 

On top of that, SBF‚Äôs dad, Joe Bankman, was the architect for Senator Warren‚Äôs tax plan when she ran for president. SBF‚Äôs mother, Barbara Fried runs a super PAC called Mind the Gap, which supports progressive candidates, who share Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs political ideology. 

12 years ago she went to D.C. to hold the big bankers accountable. A decade later, those same bankers write her bills. Her latest anti-crypto bill was written by the Banking Industry itself.

That kind of access cost him $72M in political donations to Democrats plus $10M to the current Administration. At SBF‚Äôs trial, testimony was provided that showed when SBF was asked by Caroline Ellison what‚Äôs the $10M for, SBF replied ‚Äúto gain access.‚Äù And boy did he get it. 

SBF‚Äôs dad is Joe Bankman, who wrote @ewarren‚Äôs tax policy when she ran for president. SBF‚Äôs mom is Barbara Fried. She runs Mind the Gap - a super pac dedicated to electing progressives. 

Why was SBF‚Äôs campaign finance fraud case dismissed? 

Why haven‚Äôt SBF‚Äôs parents faced criminal charges? They received $10M in stolen FTX customer funds and had tens of millions of dollars in Bahamian luxury real estate in their names, paid with stolen customer funds? 

Don‚Äôt forget, during the same time Gensler was meeting with SBF, @brian_armstrong @iampaulgrewal and @coinbase were told Gensler would not meet with them and that the SEC would not be taking Crypto meetings. ü§î 

Why would Gensler agree to meet with the CEO of an offshore exchange but not meet with the CEO of America‚Äôs largest exchange?

There was a rumor going around that Gensler was close to cutting a deal with SBF that would grant FTX a regulatory advantage. 

Gensler is üíØ a bad person. He lied before Congress multiple times. He lied about not knowing how to set up his work email at home and that‚Äôs why he used a private email while at the CFTC. This crook was the youngest partner in Goldman Sachs history, taught Blockchain at MIT, but couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfigure out‚Äù his work email? Give me a frickin break! 

He lied for @ewarren and testified-lied exactly how she told him to and said the ‚Äúonly‚Äù use case for Bitcoin and crypto assets is for criminals.

At MIT he said XRP and ETH needed regulatory clarity from the SEC and then testi-lied before Congress and said the rules were crystal clear. 

He was Hilary Clinton‚Äôs CFO and would‚Äôve been the person responsible for approving the payment for the Steele Dossier related to Russia and @realDonaldTrump. Yet, he testified-lied and said he had no idea that it was paid for by the campaign. Think about that: A SEVEN FIGURE PAYMENT is made by the Hilary Clinton Campaign but the Chief Financial Officer knows nothing about it. 

Gary Gensler is a criminal. Period. 

One way to end all the speculation and rumors related to SBF is to release all correspondence and meeting notes related to him.

However, I‚Äôm not your typical Candidate and I spent hundreds of pro bono hours and over $75K of my own money, fighting gross overreach and misconduct at the SEC, in this particular case, and on behalf of 75K token holders. 

All I asked the SEC to do was agree that XRP itself was NOT a security. It wasn‚Äôt a very big ask, considering Judge Castel, in Telegram, had specifically ruled that the Gram token, like Bitcoin, was nothing more than alphanumeric code and NOT the security. 

In addition to that ruling, 75 years of caselaw clearly established that anything could be packaged, marketed, offered and/or sold as a security but the underlying asset (or thing) itself was NEVER considered the security. 

Condos, Bitcoin, Chinchillas and üçä groves  were all previously packaged, marketed, offered and/or sold as securities. Doing so didn‚Äôt turn Bitcoin itself, üçä or condos into securities. 

Hell, even beavers ü¶´ were offered as investment contracts. Yet, ü¶´ remained  ü¶´ and not transformed into unregistered securities. 

The arguments made by the SEC in @Ripple, involving XRP, were akin to arguing that the üçä oranges produced by the Orange Groves in Howey, were unregistered securities, even if a consumer, with no knowledge of the Howey Company, purchased üçä üçä from a grocery store a thousand miles away. The SEC made the absurd argument that the üçä embodied the security. Of course, the SEC couldn‚Äôt cite a single case in history supporting its ridiculous assertion.

6505,katie_haun,112655.0,2023/11/03 10:30:27,"Now that SBF has been found guilty on all counts, people are asking what sentence he may get. I think the answer is likely decades in prison. People confuse the statutory maximum sentence (the max a judge is allowed to give) with the sentencing guidelines recommended sentence (basically advisory guidance to judges about what the starting point for a sentence should be, given the defendant‚Äôs crimes and personal history). Judges always begin their process with that sentencing guidelines recommended range.

Here‚Äôs how the sentencing guidelines work: Prison time is recommended by combining a defendant‚Äôs prior criminal history with a total numerical offense level. Take the wire fraud count. The guidelines specify an offense level of 7 (¬ß2B1.1) but that offense level gets enhanced for any number of factors the government may demonstrate (eg # of victims, amount of $ loss, sophisticated means, leadership, etc). Here, the loss amount is far and away the real driver of a recommended guidelines prison term. Although the indictment doesn‚Äôt allege a specific total monetary loss, the guidelines loss enhancements actually cap out at $550m.

Here‚Äôs some quick math re guidelines:
+7 Base Offense Level ¬ß2B1.1
+30 loss amount $550M+ ¬ß2B1.1(b)(1)(P) (big driver)
+6 25 victims suffered financial hardship ¬ß2B1.1(b)(2)(A)
+2 scheme abroad/sophisticated means ¬ß2B1.1(b)(10)
+2 leadership role ¬ß3B1.1
= 47 Total Offense Level (TOL)**

**this doesn‚Äôt take into account all other enhancements the government may pursue, or arguments the defense may advance about why certain enhancements shouldn‚Äôt apply, but they would be unlikely to impact the final calculation because the max TOL caps out at 43 anyway.

A TOL of 43 results in a recommended guidelines sentence of life in prison. Suppose, however, that the judge declined to impose some of these enhancements or cut the loss amount in half such that a TOL was closer to, say, 41. That would still yield a recommended guidelines sentence of 27-34 years. Hence why I say decades are likely. With the charges SBF has been found guilty of, the judge could theoretically impose any sentence at his discretion up to the combined statutory maximum, which by my math is around 115 years.",75.0,False,-1.0,-1

I‚Äôm ecstatic to announce that Diogo M√≥nica, one of the most exceptional founders I know, is joining us as a General Partner. In addition to co-founding and building Anchorage Digital into the success story it is today, Diogo possesses a wealth of technical experience from leading the platform security teams at Block (formerly Square), where he engineered their first encrypted card reader, and Docker, where he developed the company‚Äôs security protocols.

@diogomonica adds an entirely new flank of experiences and capabilities to what Haun Ventures can offer builders, and his arrival represents an important step for us as we construct an elite venture franchise investing at the frontier of crypto. Diogo will be transitioning to Executive Chairman of the Board of Anchorage Digital.

I first met Diogo seven years ago in San Francisco as he and Nathan McCauley were starting Anchorage Digital. Even then, it stood out that he had that rare combination of deep technical expertise, exceptional communication skills, and fierce competitive spirit‚Äîall paired with a magnetic personality (not to mention a PhD in computer science with a speciality in network security and distributed systems). We kept in contact afterwards in a variety of contexts: collaboratively, when I joined Andreessen Horowitz, where Anchorage Digital was a portfolio company; and competitively, in my role on the board of Coinbase. These connection points over time only deepened my admiration for Diogo. When I was preparing to launch my own firm and needed strategic advice, he was one of the first people I called.

I‚Äôm hardly alone in my admiration. To say Diogo is a leader within our industry is an understatement: he‚Äôs among a pioneering set of founders early to crypto that revolutionized digital asset custody to create a new standard for institutional participation in crypto. Today, Anchorage Digital is the only federally chartered crypto-native bank in the US, with assets under custody in excess of $50 billion. As both a leader and sought-after founder, Diogo has supported dozens of protocols through launch. His foresight and understanding of security infrastructure have been instrumental in shaping today's landscape and advancing broader adoption of crypto.

Diogo brings personal experience building, leading, and growing a multi-billion-dollar company. In this way, he‚Äôs a perfect complement to our existing team, which includes early operators from companies like Coinbase, Twitter, and GitHub. We know that founders crave connection with peers who have seen and solved the same challenges‚Äîbe it taking a product from zero to one, hiring and scaling teams, securing multiple funding rounds, and everything in between. It‚Äôs clear why he‚Äôs been such a desirable angel investor, backing over 100 startups across sectors from crypto to security to AI to consumer.

I knew Diogo would be a perfect fit at Haun because, like us, he‚Äôs a builder. I‚Äôve seen firsthand how he is at his best in fast-moving environments where he can roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty. His warmth and wit (he‚Äôs extremely funny, as I‚Äôve come to learn after several stints traveling the globe together for business) are what make him a wonderful teammate and a wonderful human. And we expect his boundless energy, curious mind, and fiercely competitive nature will make him an incredible asset to us and to our founders.

6510,katie_haun,112655.0,2023/07/16 5:30:24,"Some non-legal advice musings on the Ripple decision, including two main takeaways:

1/ The Court drew a reasonable line and overall it's a good outcome for the industry. For other suits w/ the SEC, we believe the Supreme Court‚Äôs ‚Äúmajor questions doctrine‚Äù will play a larger role, further strengthening the industry‚Äôs arguments.

2/ I‚Äôve long said that if Congress doesn‚Äôt act, then courts‚Äìnot the SEC‚Äìwill have the final word. The system takes time but I believe more decisions like yesterday's are coming and will provide more guidance. That said, the complexity of the court‚Äôs reasoning here is more proof that it would be most appropriate for Congress to set the policy for the future of this technology in the US.

Ripple case‚Äîwhat just happened:

I‚Äôve spoken with trusted legal colleagues (including @HaunVentures advisors Steve Engel and James Burnham) and the consensus is that the court drew a reasonable line‚Äîdistinguishing between XRP itself (not an investment contract and thus not a security) and certain XRP transactions in which institutional investors paid money to Ripple directly and Ripple made contractual commitments in exchange, creating an investment contract under Howey. As a practical matter, this tracks the line the industry will draw in upcoming cases against the SEC: tokens are never ‚Äúinvestment contracts‚Äù on their own‚Äîonly binding contracts imposing post-sale obligations on the seller can constitute investment contracts and hence tokens traded on exchanges or secondary markets would almost never qualify.

The court focused on Howey's reference to ""contract, transaction, or scheme,"" and concluded that ""XRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a 'contract, transaction[,] or scheme' that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract."" Again, just like orange groves, whiskey casks, payphones, condos, and beavers(!), tokens can be the subject of an investment contract but are not themselves investment contracts or securities. This means that even if a token were sold pursuant to an investment contract initially, the resale of the same token is not necessarily an investment contract and therefore not a security.

While the court landed in a reasonable place, it largely (though not entirely) rejected the simplest argument for getting there‚Äîthat an ‚Äúinvestment contract‚Äù requires a contract that imposes post-sale obligations on the seller and that enables the buyer to share in profits.  Ripple calls this the ""essential ingredients"" test and argues that these ingredients were the entire premise of Howey, and thus must be present before you get to the Howey factors. Many, myself included, believe the Supreme Court will eventually adopt a version of this argument‚Äîrejecting the SEC‚Äôs claim that something can be an ‚Äúinvestment contract‚Äù where there is no contract of any kind. (Judge Torres declined to address one aspect of this argument‚Äîthat a legally binding contract must exist before an ‚Äúinvestment contract‚Äù can arise‚Äîon the ground that a contract did exist ‚Äúin each instance‚Äù where Ripple sold XRP.)  We‚Äôll have to wait and see how this plays out in other cases.

Overall, the court‚Äôs decision is pretty favorable for the industry, particularly the secondary markets at issue in some pending suits. And I believe the law will continue to improve as more cases are decided and more courts engage with the broader principles at stake‚Äîthe major questions doctrine foremost among them.

Re the SEC and an appeal: anything is possible, but an immediate appeal seems unlikely both because the agency would have to ask the court to split this decision from the portion going to trial and because I‚Äôm skeptical the SEC actually wants legal clarity. The Commission benefits from the current confusion and losing these issues on appeal would jeopardize its entire enforcement agenda. So I‚Äôd be surprised if the SEC tried to appeal now.

More proof that these are questions for Congress:

The Ripple decision is an example of the challenging questions this technology is forcing the law to contend with. Even if the outcome here was positive overall, the complexity of the court‚Äôs reasoning suggests that existing laws and jurisprudence may be ill-equipped to contend with all the important policy concerns at play. The major questions doctrine seems built for crypto at this moment: major decisions on policy like this are for Congress, not unelected agencies. Likewise, the court system is critical as an interpreter of law, but does not itself make policy.

Stablecoins are to finance what broadband was to the web: the substrate for something much larger. They represent one of the most tangible use cases for crypto‚Äîa digital dollar that moves at the speed of the internet, backed by real-world assets like U.S. dollars and Treasury bonds. What began as tools for crypto trading are now rapidly evolving into a foundational layer for global payments.

Stablecoins enable seamless global payment systems that truly meet the needs of a global economy. From major fintechs and traditional financial institutions to multinational enterprises, stablecoins are being used for remittances, merchant payouts, treasury management, and B2B flows, unlocking speed, interoperability, and transparency in ways legacy systems cannot.

They are quickly becoming core financial infrastructure. Citibank recently released a report projecting that stablecoin circulation could grow from approximately $230 billion today to $1.6 trillion (base case) or $3.7 trillion (bull case) by 2030. Citi also estimates that stablecoin issuers could drive more than $1 trillion in net new purchases of U.S. Treasuries by 2030‚Äîpotentially surpassing any single foreign country as holders of U.S. government debt.

The financial implications of this shift are massive. New research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that stablecoin flows compress short-term Treasury bill yields, producing effects similar to small-scale quantitative easing, ultimately helping reduce the national debt at a time when it is otherwise soaring. There are also national security implications, given that the current largest holders of U.S. debt are foreign countries with complex geopolitical relationships.

Stablecoins are digital dollars, core payments infrastructure, and increasingly, monetary instruments with global policy relevance. As SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda emphasized this week, tokenized assets offer ‚Äúgreater efficiencies in settlement, recordkeeping, and compliance.‚Äù Regulatory frameworks should evolve to embrace these capabilities, not resist them.

Legislation like the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act provides the regulatory scaffolding for stablecoin issuance in the U.S., including provisions for audits, 1:1 reserves, and state/federal oversight. This doesn‚Äôt just unlock safer onchain activity for existing crypto users; it creates an entirely new avenue for institutional use cases and helps preserve America‚Äôs economic leadership in the global financial system.

Tokenization won‚Äôt stop at money. The next wave will bring real-world assets (RWAs)‚Äîfrom equities and bonds to funds and private credit‚Äîonchain. Stablecoins have demonstrated the playbook: start with simple, high-velocity use cases, build trust through scale, then extend the architecture to more complex assets.

6872,mikebelshe,31099.0,2023/09/12 3:49:40,"I can‚Äôt express enough how upsetting this Fortress Trust episode is to me. I really don‚Äôt want to talk about it at all, because it actually has nothing to do with BitGo.  But because Fortress was not forthcoming about what actually did happen, we are now indirectly affected - Fortress‚Äô clients are wondering what happened, if they are still at risk, and whether BitGo was somehow involved (spoiler alert: we were not).  

As you can see from Jameson‚Äôs message below, when Fortress lost funds, they chose to omit facts about what happened, downplay the event, and conclude, ‚Äúmost importantly, no funds were lost.‚Äù Obviously we now know this was not true. I guess what they meant to say is, ‚Äúwe believe we fixed the problem, and we have taken steps to make sure clients are made whole.‚Äù  But those two statements are not even close to being the same.

Ripple has done the right thing and disclosed that a breach did occur.  But Fortress still has not made a real statement about what actually happened.  So, summarizing what is publicly known, along with what we know from BitGo:

1) Fortress suffered a breach through some third party integration (not BitGo)
2) via Fortress‚Äôs platform and some 3rd party integration (not BitGo), the attacker was able to drain funds from Fortress‚Äôs hot wallet system.
3) Fortress used Fireblocks for its hot wallet system (not BitGo)
4) Fortress noticed the failure, and says they have fixed the problem with the 3rd party.
5) Although Fortress did use BitGo to custody some of its bitcoin & digital assets, BitGo was not affected.  None of the Fortress assets held at BitGo were at risk from this 3rd party integration or taken.

After the breach, Fortress reached out to BitGo. BitGo strongly advised Fortress to disclose what happened immediately. Fortress did not do that.  Eventually, Fortress decided to sell to Ripple. This is a great outcome because Ripple was able to make all clients whole and will hopefully help Fortress with resources to correct the security weaknesses which led to this event.  Ripple is a good actor here and should be applauded.

The real victims here are Fortress‚Äô clients who deserved enough respect to get the whole truth.  They are not to be blamed.

This is the whole situation is exactly why we need decentralization. We can‚Äôt continue to be dependent on the honesty of custodians, bankers, or ‚Äútrusted third parties‚Äù acting with integrity when bad things happen.  Bad things will happen, and most humans don‚Äôt have enough courage to be honest through it.

BitGo, as a decentralized wallet platform and also a centralized custodian, will continue to fight to eliminate humans from the mix, to ensure that our financial system is not dependent on any one person‚Äôs integrity, and to provide transparency wherever possible.

If we aren't banking at a major bank, it's because they told us no.  We tried them all.  This is still happening and won't change until Jan 20.

Importantly, one of the great separations in our nation is that of federal and state powers.  When the OCC banned crypto in 2022 for federal banks, the state banks should have picked up the slack.  And they would have, except for the FDIC, which is another *federal* agency.  Unfortunately, the FDIC is the only uncapped insurance program available for banks and they all need it.  So when Gruenberg told all state banks that touching crypto would mandate additional FDIC scrutiny, most of them opted out.  The result is that a single bad federal administrator (Biden) was able to knock out not just federal banking for crypto, but state banking too. 

Gensler was the scapegoat for government overreach in crypto, Hsu, Gruenberg, and Yellen deserve just as much blame.  @elonmusk @doge @pmarca

7023,muneeb,122151.0,2024/02/04 10:10:46,"Quick thoughts from Satoshi Round Table in Dubai:

- The Bitcoin L2 session yesterday was the largest session I‚Äôve seen here. Packed and 5 Bitcoin L2 projects there.

- Today, multiple parallel sessions going on about Bitcoin L2s, BitVM, peg security, Bitcoin Defi etc.

- BitVM changes the game because you effectively get trustless BTC movement to L2s (1-of-n honest assumption).

- $100B Bitcoin L2 market seems conservative given the potential here of truly (and finally!) unleashing BTC the asset via programmable L2s.

- Some founders of Bitcoin apps & protocols who couldn‚Äôt raise rounds even 6 months ago are now oversubscribed. VC money chasing seed stage deals for Bitcoin L2s and apps.

- Entities in Stacks L2 ecosystem have vested interest in seeing BitVM based L2 bridge work (reduces trust assumptions). Likely millions in capital coming into more R&D for BitVM. I know I‚Äôll do it from Trust Machines.

- People coming up and saying congrats for staying the course and fighting off the maxis/fundamentalists. Huge narrative shift in Bitcoin where the builders (L1 and L2s) are bringing back innovation to Bitcoin vs boring/stale narrative of maxis you saw before. 

- Bitcoin L2s likely emerge quickly as a top category next cycle given the new devs and capital moving in. It‚Äôs a race against time now. 3-5 new L2s launching within 6 months. 10+ more in 12-18 months. Stacks continues to lead market right now and Nakamoto upgrade more important than ever. I want to see the category grow: grow the pie for everyone. It‚Äôs not zero sum.

- Bitcoin dominance can increase in industry if Bitcoin L2s take off. Bitcoin L2s will suck BTC in (similar to how ETFs are taking BTC off the market) and increase demand for BTC. Your BTC becomes more valuable given the work of these L2 devs and what they‚Äôre pushing forward.

7025,muneeb,122151.0,2024/03/11 9:56:11,"The first Bitcoin all-time high (ATH) I experienced was $100 in 2013.

Seeing $72,000 today is surreal. Some thoughts for people new to Bitcoin:

- Bitcoin has been declared dead dozens of times. It keeps coming back to life. Maybe it‚Äôs time to put aside your first impressions of Bitcoin, put aside the false narratives of MSM, and take a deeper dive into understanding it.

- I initially thought of Bitcoin as merely a new technology. It took me years to appreciate BTC, the monetary asset. BTC is a true store of value, superior to gold. Fiat money can be inflated away. View fiat currencies as inherently depreciating assets. Their demise is accelerating as governments worldwide become more inefficient and overrun by debt.

- The riskiest part of Bitcoin is already in the rearview mirror. The network has been running for 10+ years now. Bitcoin going from $100 to $70,000 is a 700x (unlikely event). That unlikely event has already happened. A 10x from here is not unimaginable at all. Once Bitcoin flips gold, the world will change. It would help if you started preparing for that world.

- Most criticisms of Bitcoin, like energy use, scalability, etc, have excellent answers. The reality is very different from the superficial understanding of the critics. Bitcoin helps with wasted/stranded energy, reduces gas flaring, incentivizes renewables and other energy innovation, balances the grid, and is really good for the environment. Bitcoin L2s (layer 2) don‚Äôt cost energy and help scale BTC to billions of people.

- In the last ten years, I‚Äôve never met anyone who thought they were early in discovering Bitcoin. They all think, ‚ÄúI wish I discovered Bitcoin sooner.‚Äù The same is true today; the same will be true ten years from now. You are not late.

- A small allocation to Bitcoin, like 1-2%, was risky ten years ago. Not having any exposure to Bitcoin is risky today. I now advocate for a 5-10% Bitcoin allocation to friends and family.

There are some inventions, like the steam engine or electricity, that completely and permanently change the world and how humans live their lives. Bitcoin is one such invention.

- First of all, Ethereum deserves credit for fostering dev culture and experimentation with new ideas. We joke that it‚Äôs ‚ÄúBTC Denver‚Äù now, but the reality is that Bitcoin has been MIA since 2017, and devs in the ETH ecosystem (later in Solana and others) carried the flag.

- The Bitcoin renaissance is real. More than 1,000 people registered for the Bitcoin L2 event (not organized by us), and the energy and dev momentum there was palpable. I was trying to help create Bitcoin L2s as a category before. Now, it feels like no one can stop Bitcoin L2s from emerging even if they tried.

- There were a few rotten tomatoes (ETH maxis) who left a bad taste on smaller incidents, but overall the community and vibe were super friendly, open to Bitcoin, and builder-focused. I enjoyed my time a lot, made new connections and learned new things from devs in the trenches.

- BitVM is a game changer. I haven‚Äôt met a Bitcoin L2 yet that doesn‚Äôt want to help support it (Stacks ecosystem included), and we should expect rapid R&D and advancement in BitVM-based L1 to L2 bridges with minimal trust.

- Bitcoin L2 and DeFi apps on Bitcoin L2 are attracting significant capital now. I got so many pings from investors to help connect with new founders. DM me. I want to be helpful and can add you to Telegram groups where we share early-stage Bitcoin L2 deal flow.

- Stacks ecosystem continues to be a leader in this category. People come up to me and say sweet things like ‚ÄúYou guys believed when no one did‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou kept building when there was no light at the end of the tunnel.‚Äù I appreciate all these comments. Looking back, I think we held an irrational belief that all successful experiments in crypto will eventually come to Bitcoin. It took a few years longer than we expected, but we survived and are now emerging as stronger than ever to make it happen.

- A strong sense I got from new L2 projects and new devs building apps is that we all want to grow the pie for everyone. That‚Äôd be my strong preference as well. Bitcoin L2s right now are too small a category for needless completion and in-fighting. We are all here to grow the BTC economy. We all win if Bitcoin wins. Let‚Äôs focus on that.

In summary, I am leaving Denver more bullish than ever on BTC (which is all my savings for 11 years now) and bullish on Bitcoin L2s and builder culture.

""Always carry a flask of whiskey in case of snakebite, and furthermore always carry a small snake."" -- W. C. Fields

About six months ago, I stopped drinking alcohol. I feel much better, and I‚Äôm mad as hell about it.

I never really drank through my 20s and 30s, but grew to really enjoy whiskey through my 40s, coincident with ‚ÄúMad Men‚Äù, and roughly a thousand academic studies that proved that alcohol is actually good for you. Win/win!

I had read that the sure sign of an alcoholic is someone who drinks at night, by himself, at home, so I decided to only drink at night, by myself, at home.

I was even scurrilously quoted as saying ‚Äúthe perfect day is 10 hours of caffeine followed by 4 hours of alcohol‚Äù, which I did indeed say, and which is still indeed true.

Unfortunately, in recent years, it‚Äôs become clear that most or all ‚Äî probably all ‚Äî of the scientific studies on the benefits of alcohol are fake, the scientists unwitting or witting victims of selection effects. As Michael Crichton says, ‚Äúwet streets cause rain‚Äù, or rather wet streets don‚Äôt cause rain. It turns out that sick people often don‚Äôt drink, or subjects just lie to researchers about their consumption outright. There go the studies.

It is now pretty definitively clear that no amount of alcohol is good for you. Andrew Huberman recently summed this conclusion up on his podcast; the topic made me so enraged I never listened to the episode, but I did read the notes.

Andrew says ‚Äúthe best amount of alcohol to drink is no alcohol‚Äù ‚Äî imagine someone who both hates and loves humanity that much.

Since I stopped drinking, I feel much better. I don‚Äôt need as much sleep, but my sleep is better. I‚Äôm more alert through the day. I‚Äôm cogent and focused at all times. I have more energy when I exercise, and it‚Äôs easier to control my diet.

It‚Äôs great, and I am super mad about it.

I feel like the color has drained out of my evenings[*]. Spending time with people is still fun, but now it‚Äôs hard to sit still and watch a movie or read a book and unwind at the end of a hard day. I‚Äôm more prone to just work until bedtime. Grump grump grump.

Frankly, I don‚Äôt know what Elon is doing farting around with cars and rockets and Twitter, why doesn‚Äôt he solve THIS problem[**].

And one of these days, I am going to get deeply, seriously, hammered.

But not today!

[*] A lot of people I know are substituting cannabis or hallucinogens for alcohol. I‚Äôm not, I won‚Äôt touch any of those things ‚Äî a topic for another time.

[**] I‚Äôve been trying all the alcohol free whiskeys, wine, and beer. So far, no luck on the whiskeys. For wine, Sovi is pretty good. For beer, there are quite a few good choices; I‚Äôve become partial to Hopwtr, which is zero calorie hop-flavored sparkling water.

""Always carry a flask of whiskey in case of snakebite, and furthermore always carry a small snake."" -- W. C. Fields

About six months ago, I stopped drinking alcohol. I feel much better, and I‚Äôm mad as hell about it.

I never really drank through my 20s and 30s, but grew to really enjoy whiskey through my 40s, coincident with ‚ÄúMad Men‚Äù, and roughly a thousand academic studies that proved that alcohol is actually good for you. Win/win!

I had read that the sure sign of an alcoholic is someone who drinks at night, by himself, at home, so I decided to only drink at night, by myself, at home.

I was even scurrilously quoted as saying ‚Äúthe perfect day is 10 hours of caffeine followed by 4 hours of alcohol‚Äù, which I did indeed say, and which is still indeed true.

Unfortunately, in recent years, it‚Äôs become clear that most or all ‚Äî probably all ‚Äî of the scientific studies on the benefits of alcohol are fake, the scientists unwitting or witting victims of selection effects. As Michael Crichton says, ‚Äúwet streets cause rain‚Äù, or rather wet streets don‚Äôt cause rain. It turns out that sick people often don‚Äôt drink, or subjects just lie to researchers about their consumption outright. There go the studies.

It is now pretty definitively clear that no amount of alcohol is good for you. Andrew Huberman recently summed this conclusion up on his podcast; the topic made me so enraged I never listened to the episode, but I did read the notes.

Andrew says ‚Äúthe best amount of alcohol to drink is no alcohol‚Äù ‚Äî imagine someone who both hates and loves humanity that much.

Since I stopped drinking, I feel much better. I don‚Äôt need as much sleep, but my sleep is better. I‚Äôm more alert through the day. I‚Äôm cogent and focused at all times. I have more energy when I exercise, and it‚Äôs easier to control my diet.

It‚Äôs great, and I am super mad about it.

I feel like the color has drained out of my evenings[*]. Spending time with people is still fun, but now it‚Äôs hard to sit still and watch a movie or read a book and unwind at the end of a hard day. I‚Äôm more prone to just work until bedtime. Grump grump grump.

Frankly, I don‚Äôt know what Elon is doing farting around with cars and rockets and Twitter, why doesn‚Äôt he solve THIS problem[**].

And one of these days, I am going to get deeply, seriously, hammered.

But not today!

[*] A lot of people I know are substituting cannabis or hallucinogens for alcohol. I‚Äôm not, I won‚Äôt touch any of those things ‚Äî a topic for another time.

[**] I‚Äôve been trying all the alcohol free whiskeys, wine, and beer. So far, no luck on the whiskeys. For wine, Sovi is pretty good. For beer, there are quite a few good choices; I‚Äôve become partial to Hopwtr, which is zero calorie hop-flavored sparkling water.

7748,RuneKek,57517.0,2024/05/16 12:12:17,"Reconciling the two opposing paths for Decentralized Stablecoins

From the moment Dai started scaling, it has been straddling two worlds.

One world is the culture of pure decentralization as introduced with Bitcoin. The other is the desire to fulfill the original purpose of Dai, by delivering utility and value to real people at scale.

Unfortunately these two worlds are fundamentally in friction with each other, as noted by the Stablecoin Trilemma, which states that achieving a dollar peg, maintaining pure decentralization, and scaling to large sizes simultaneously is not feasible.

There are two main options for solving the Stablecoin Trilemma:

1. Prioritize Utility and Scale by choosing dollar peg + real world asset collateral, which requires integration with traditional finance (TradFi) and alignment with real world entities. Because utility and scalability are so fundamental for growth, it is almost impossible to find a major DeFi project that hasn‚Äôt made this tradeoff, or relies on stablecoins that have made this tradeoff. Decentralization is important everywhere it offers the best path towards practical resilience.

2. Take the path of pure decentralization and demand complete independence from centralized control and strict reliance on decentralized collateral. While conventional wisdom says that it is a lot harder to achieve significant growth when optimizing for decentralization above all else, the Maker community has always believed that there is potential in this approach, and that a natural legitimate userbase exists for this kind of stablecoin.

Endgame is an opportunity for the Maker community to execute decisively on realizing the full vision of both of these competing directions, without compromise, by doing them separately.

This post describes changes to accomplish this. That will be introduced through a future proposal to edit the Maker Atlas, to be confirmed by a governance vote by MKR holders.

The transition to the dual stablecoin solution should be a gradual, deliberate process over several years. Eventually, most Dai use cases will be succeeded by NewStable, which will focus on mass market adoption and regulatorily compliant Real-World Asset (RWA) backing, with decentralization used as a powerful tool to ensure transparency, resilience, and checks and balances.

To complement NewStable, a second, purely decentralized stablecoin, called PureDai, will also be made available as an option for users who prefer the vision of pure decentralization.

Holders of Dai will be able to upgrade to either of these options. The ability to upgrade from Dai to NewStable at a 1:1 basis will begin in the short term, while the option to upgrade from Dai to PureDai will follow at a later date. Dai will continue to function as today, and if in doubt Dai users can simply keep holding their Dai.

NewStable

NewStable will be the main successor to Dai focused on growth, yield and resilience. As noted in previous Endgame posts, NewStable is a code name that will be dropped once the new branding is unveiled later this year.

NewStable follows the trajectory Dai has taken and will focus on utility and adoption, with all of its features tailored towards this goal. NewStable will be a decentralized stablecoin that uses decentralization as a means to achieve practical ends, by making its governance and infrastructure as resilient and transparent as possible.

NewStable will take over the RWA- and tradfi integrations of Dai, deepening and improving them, and making them more resilient over time through its resilient and decentralized governance processes and transparent infrastructure.

NewStable will remain attached to Maker and gain the tokenomics, growth focus and governance features of Endgame.

Future freeze function

To ensure NewStable can safely reach global scale, it will eventually be upgraded to have a freeze function similar to the industry standard of other major RWA-backed stablecoins. The freeze function will not be implemented in NewStable at launch, but the token will have upgradeability so that it can later be implemented by governance vote.

Dai will remain as it is today with no possibility of adding a freeze function due to the technical immutability of its ERC-20 implementation.

The future freeze function is generally expected to follow rule of law from jurisdictions where Maker needs a high level of certainty that the legal system will enforce recourse against RWA collateral. This will result in a much greater level of security, stability and reliability of using large scale RWA collateral for NewStable as it scales to global mass market adoption.

The timeline for when the freeze function is implemented will likely be many months or even years, depending on the growth trajectory of NewStable. The future freeze function will be implemented in a way that leverages the decentralized governance and transparent processes of MakerDAO, to ensure it will be a risk-minimized process with checks and balances.

A follow up post that details how the advantages of decentralized governance and infrastructure can be tapped into will be published later this week.

Dai after NewStable Launch

Dai users will be able to upgrade to NewStable during Launch Season as planned, however they can also choose to stay with Dai. Dai will remain as it is today with no possibility of adding a freeze function due to the technical immutability of its ERC-20 implementation.

Dai will remain pegged to USD and will be upgradeable to NewStable any time the user wishes. It will also be possible to instantly reverse the process and convert any amount of NewStable to Dai. Dai will be used as a liquidity and integrations backend for NewStable, as NewStable apps and frontends can leverage the instant 1:1 Dai/NewStable conversion to provide better UX.

After an initial transition period (the current estimate is at least 1 year), DSR will begin to be phased out by gradually ramping the rate down over time. Eventually, yield will only be available on NewStable.

PureDai

Dai users in the future will have the option of upgrading their Dai to PureDai, which is a return to the ideological roots of Dai. PureDai will feature only purely decentralized collateral such as ETH and stETH, free-floating peg like Rai, maximally decentralized oracles and no governance or budgets.

PureDai will be available after a few years, and will be released in its final, immutable form. From the moment it is released it will require no further upgrades or changes, and will be completely independent from Maker. The launch of PureDai will have similarities with the launch of the Initial SubDAOs, and will leverage tools and experience to help make it as successful as possible, but PureDai will be fundamentally different from a SubDAO as it will have no permanent connection to Maker once launched.

Once PureDai is released, Dai users will be able to easily upgrade to it from the Maker frontends. PureDai will be deployed only on Ethereum mainnet, but L2‚Äôs and bridges may choose to support transporting it to other blockchains.

PureDai will feature a new brand that is optimized for communicating the specific, unique value proposition of PureDai. Until the rebrand is unveiled in advance of the launch of the finished PureDai system, PureDai is used as a temporary placeholder name.

A follow-up post that goes into detail about the preliminary specification of PureDai will be posted later this week.

What happens to Dai in the long term?

After the launch of PureDai, Dai users will have two complementary choices available to them: They can upgrade to NewStable and take advantage of its USD peg and yield features, or they can upgrade to PureDai to gain the advantages of its fully decentralized collateral.

Eventually, after multiple years, it is expected that Dai will be fully deprecated as all users and integrations migrate to either NewStable or PureDai. The timeline for when this happens will depend on how quickly the ecosystem adopts NewStable and PureDai.

What happens to MKR?

As communicated in earlier Endgame Posts, MKR will stay around and be attached to MakerDAO as it rebrands and Launch Season begins. MKR holders will have the option to upgrade to NewGovToken at a ratio of 1:24,000. It will also be possible to convert NewGovToken to MKR, reversing the process.

MKR holders can choose to keep holding their MKR, as the new features of NewGovToken also apply to MKR. It will be possible to use the LockStake Engine directly with MKR without having to upgrade to NewGovToken.

Upcoming explainers

* Thursday there will be a follow-up post containing a deep dive on PureDai, with its current specification. The specification is relatively simple, and of course will be subject to change, but will still provide a good overview of the principles at this stage.

* Friday there will be a follow-up post providing more context about the principles and ideas for how decentralized governance and the advanced governance capabilities of Maker Endgame can be leveraged to make a more transparent and more fair stablecoin freeze function process.

A big reason for why the terror attack was possible is obviously oil money funding, but also just the zero-sum mindset of conquest that drilling oil out of the ground instills on people (the resource curse).

Energy independence through technological solutions will have a huge impact on reducing terror, suffering and war in the world because it can break this pattern and bring us to a world where to achieve your aims, the only option is to build.

If you want to actually make a difference for peace then there are two technological solutions you can support, that will do so much more than any of the diplomatic or military solutions that have been tried over and over for decades.

1) Nuclear Energy

Nuclear energy is the tragically obvious technology that will promote peace because it can eliminate the zero sum dynamics created by natural gas and LNG, and also massively increase energy security of all countries in the world, increase desalination and other life saving technology. It is extremely safe, clean and cheap, but is held back by broken and evil regulatory sabotage perpetuated by various entrenched interests, including an unholy alliance between the extreme left and big fossil fuel.

Simply advocating for nuclear energy and help prove its political and popular viability will be a huge boost to energy indepence and prosperity for the whole world, and will directly make a real lasting difference in moving the world towards more peace and less terror.

Even better is working in nuclear, studying nuclear engineering, financing BWRX-300 newbuilds or other cool opportunities that are coming. 

2) Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL)

HTL is the best bet for a technology than can straight up replace oil drilling. It is a simple method that uses water, heat and pressure to produce biocrude from any kind of material that contains carbon, including biowaste, sewage, regular garbage, plastic etc.

The biocrude is upgraded and refined into gas for cars, diesel for trucks and mining vehicles, kerosene for airplanes, bunker fuel for ships, and polymers for plastic.

All of this is net zero in co2 terms since it is just recycling the same organic carbon over and over.

The technology is not yet at commercial viability where it can beat crude oil drilled from the ground, but with more innovation, attention and massive scale it should be able to get there. The upside, beyond perpetual clean, cheap transport fuels, is that we can end the possibility of oil money being used to fund terrorism, wars and other destructive zero sum behaviour.

ETH price at $2.2k is hilarious.

Everyone out here trading ""what ifs"" this cycle when Ethereum has fundamentals. 

Let my tell you why $2.2k ETH is stooopid.

Ethereum now makes $2.7 billion in annualized profits - the only profitable chain - a P/E ratio of 98 - a slightly more than Amazon P/E of 75 less than Zoom P/E of 153.

Ethereum now has entire chains as net new buyers of blockspace this cycle - these are called Layer 2's - last wk five Layer 2 were the top 10 consumers of Ethereum blockspace.

Ethereum is deflationary this cycle - last cycle it inflated 3-4% per year and this cycle it'll burn around .5% per year.

Ethereum is now further solidified as a monetary instrument - a digital gold - value this as you will - if it had the monetary amplifier of gold it'd already be worth $22k.

Ethereum bond holders are now earning 5.3% per year - we call these validators - unlike other chains these are ""real returns"" not just nominal returns - ETH is the internet bond.

Ethereum is likely to get a spot ETF - it's likely only BTC and ETH will achieve this status this cycle opening the door to trillions in locked capital inflows.

Ethereum is now fully proof of stake and no longer burns energy to produce blockspace - for traditional ESG investors the ETF Ethereum will be the only one that checks the box this cycle.

As we look ahead to 2025, it was a pleasure to talk again with the brilliant Dr. Kiesha King @DrKieshaKing  Natl Head of Education Strategy, T-Mobile for Education ‚ö°@TMobileBusiness  especially discussing action on areas so close to heart: Bridging the Rural Divide and the transformative potential of 5G in education! ‚ö°

Key points include: 
üåü Impact of 5G on Rural Education:
üî∏5G's low latency and extended reach afford opportunities for rural areas with previously limited or poor-quality connectivity.
üî∏5G facilitates real-time, interactive learning experiences, such as virtual #Science labs, global classroom debates and #hackathons , moving from isolated to connected learning and supporting real-time collaboration! 

üåü Emerging Technologies in Education:
üîπVirtual Reality (#VR) and Augmented Reality (#AR) are reshaping #teaching methods, offering hands-on interactive learning in subjects from biology to history to maths! The end result - immersive educational experiences!
üîπThe value of #Esports and #Gaming for education is being elevated by 5G and brings in new audiences and approaches to personal learning and growth 

üåü Career Preparation & Workforce Development:
üî∏Programs integrating 5G and #IoT technologies prepare students for accelerating fields such as smart agriculture and #sustainable farming.
üî∏We believe in a focus on expanding #STEM to #STEAM learning and fostering a broader skill set for confidence and adaptability to change

üåü Equity and Accessibility:
üîπ5G and AI enhance personalized learning, address different learning styles, afford feedback and open-up new pathways to education for underserved communities. Approaches such as metacognition are recommended too! 
üîπInitiatives like Project 10Million, EmpowerED Program and the use of E-Rate Funds to equip school buses with Wi-Fi and provide #CyberSecurity training, are just some examples in action that are enhancing equity and #accessibility 

‚ö°Call to Action:
In our conversation, Dr. King and I emphasise collaboration, policy support, and active involvement to ensure equitable access to educational tools and opportunities globally. Real transformation is happening NOW and we believe the combination of 5G and emerging technologies can cultivate a diverse innovative and vital future workforce. 
üí¨And we would love your thoughts and to get involved‚Äì all feedback & questions most welcome! üí¨

8303,shayne_coplan,88030.0,2024/10/26 12:20:12,"Given the latest New York Times article on Polymarket, this seems like a good time to make clear:

‚Ä¢ Polymarket is strictly non-partisan. We get told we're Dem operatives and MAGA, depending on the day. Unfortunately the story is much less juicy, we're just market nerds who think prediction markets provide the public with a much needed alternative data source. It's naturally a fit in a world where there are infinite opinions being served to you algorithmically based on what you already think, designed only to keep you engaged and push you further into an echo chamber. If just one thing, Polymarket is a reality check.

‚Ä¢ Polymarket is not about politics. The vision never was to be a political website, and it still isn't. From launch day, the goal has been to, ""harness the power of free markets to demystify the real world events that matter most to you."" This US election cycle, we've been pulled onto center stage, as people are fed up with having to make sense of 'For You' feeds, pundits, and incongruent polls - we take that responsibility seriously. Polymarket's rise in popularity correlates with correctly forecasting Biden dropping out - it was the one source that called it. Hopefully politics is the first step to get the masses to realize the value of market-based forecasts.

‚Ä¢ It's crazy I have to say this, but it's time to put the ""Thiel-controlled"" narrative to rest. He has no direct contact or control with the company. Founders Fund, one of the most active VC funds (Airbnb, Stripe, etc.), and one of our 50+ investors, has a minority stake in the company with no board seat/control - and the partner who did the Polymarket deal isn't even Thiel. His politics have no bearing on how Polymarket works, operates, or what the prices are - end of story.

The beauty of Polymarket is it's all peer-to-peer and transparent. Even more transparent than traditional finance, where all the data is obfuscated and only visible to the operator. That's why everyone is able to audit all the usage - which is a good thing for free markets. A feature, not a bug. 

The market sets the price, not the operator. There is no ""house"" setting the odds. It's the invisible hand, not the thumb on the scale. The idea is if people disagree with the market price, they have the opportunity to capitalize by buying the side they think is priced too low.

As these markets get more popular, liquid, and accessible, we foresee a world where markets guide decision making, and opinions are backed by capital. The downstream effect is an information landscape with less sensationalism and more truth. Onwards",755.0,False,-1.0,-1

8596,StaniKulechov,266069.0,2025/01/19 11:07:54,"Let's be clear about something regarding Ethereum.

1. Highest security

First of all Ethereum has the highest security amongst the programmable execution environments.

Yes this matters. When world moves onchain, that means that most important and mission critical use-cases will use Ethereum. Most importantly this means $25T finance industry.

2. DeFi TVL

The only PMF for onchain has been DeFi. Out of the 122B TVL Ethereum is the home for over half of it and almost 6x to the second biggest.

The economies of scale is on Ethereum. Mainnet Aave is the only place you can borrow $1B in stables by posting a collateral. You can't do it anywhere else.

All the most relevant DeFi innovation I keep being pitched is still on Ethereum.

3. Developer ecosystem and tooling

While building DeFi sounds an easy to replicate anywhere, that is not really the case. DeFi protocols need solid network security and stability to be able to serve collateralized products and any product that include a oracle price feed.

Second, in most nascent network ecosystems its much more harder to build DeFi and to secure it.

Ethereum has advantage here as the developer ecosystem has build solid tooling around development (Hardhat, Foundry), multiple different testing tools, i.e. different fuzzy-testing, simulation tooling such as Tenderly for debugging and robust ecosystem of auditors that are really going deep into the code and caring, not just rubber stamping audit reports.

4. EVM innovation

EVM has been the most valuable innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem. We are seeing more exciting innovation happening on EVM space, including from ZK-based EVMs to solve scalability from ZKSync, Scroll to Linea and Succinct. Instead of seeing one path of innovation, we are seeing multiple options competing to provide the best scalability and also privacy for users.

5. L2 strategy (+ Beef up Ethereum L1)

People critisize the L2 strategy on Ethereum but it actually works. It allows L1 to offer highest security for Ethereum while allowing innovation to foster on L2s (as per previous point). Every major exchange or institution is looking to run their own network. They want customization and they want economics.

How I would like to see this continue is that we keep innovating on the L1 side, and beef up Ethereum mainnet, faster.

Once cross-chain liquidity is solved and ux challenges are removed, it all feels unified, and super fast.

6. POTUS is building on Ethereum

WLF Aave instance is going to be deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Lot of innovation will follow on DeFi with WLF. This is where POTUS fundamentals are happening.

7. The institutions are deploying on Ethereum

For institutions like BlackRock their main base is Ethereum and this is because Ethereum provides the highest security and stability for institutions to issue assets like RWAs, its also where all the DeFi network effects are.

8. Talent pool

Most of the talented smart contract developers are on Ethereum, writing Solidity. This is also the reason why the most biggest protocols are on Ethereum and have been running for years and the same reason why the developer tooling on Ethereum is light years ahead of everything else. It's a more mature ecosystem.

Remember, onchain is full of short term (very risky) opportunities that take the moment of attention but what really matters down the line is fundamentals. The ecosystems and its users that focus most of fundamentals will get the most adoption.

It's just a matter of time when ETH pumps, but when it does, it's going to be the biggest revenge pump ever.",537.0,False,-1.0,-1

A common misconception is that DeFi is only useful when there is ‚Äúcollateral,‚Äù and it‚Äôs not beneficial for people seeking ‚Äúloans.‚Äù

This is not the case. Protocols like Aave can actually serve as the backbone for all credit extensions in the real world, anywhere globally.

The concept of collateral is present in all credit transactions. In DeFi, we are primarily accustomed to crypto collaterals or tokenized assets. In traditional finance (TradFi), collateral ranges from mortgage-backed credit to credit extensions based on credit scores, where consumers' future cash flows are used as collateral.

The key to using Aave for every loan issued globally is tokenization.

This means real-world credit would be tokenized and then used as collateral to unlock more liquidity, funding similar loans in the real world.

Of course, all loans should be credit-rated, and not all tokenized credit can be used in Aave‚Äôs Blue Chip main market (though some will be). However, there will be other markets on Aave where these types of credit will be a good fit.

Eventually, Aave could become the backbone for all credit extensions, empowering finance and credit extension in the most democratic and neutral way.

Similarly, Maker could be used for global savings, providing access to savings for every single person on the planet.

Uniswap could be used to exchange all forms of value, including tokenized credit.

8621,StaniKulechov,266069.0,2024/12/18 8:47:14,"My thoughts on the Polygon bridge funds investment proposal:

1. The Polygon team (with the help of their friends) created a proposal to take users' funds from the Polygon bridge and invest them into DeFi without sufficient risk protection. Behind closed doors, they selected the partners and some say secured a huge token deal.

2. After reading the proposal, Polygon users, rightly, were uncomfortable with their funds being double-spent, similar to fractional banking.

3. Aave service providers (including risk providers) learned about the proposal and given that 40% of Polygon‚Äôs TVL is deposited into Aave, Aave's primary governance function operates on Polygon, and the existing Safety Module insures the market on Polygon, this proposal had significant impact on Aave's risk management.

4. ACI took action to open a discussion around adjusting risk parameters to protect users' funds (considering the PTSD from the Harmony bridge hack). Other notable contributors, such as @AndreCronjeTech, voiced similar concerns in governance discussions.

5. The Polygon team abandoned the mission, quickly spun a narrative about not supporting the proposal, and blamed Aave's leadership for the failure of the proposal.

They also made several inaccurate claims about Aave's infrastructure. Let‚Äôs clarify for accuracy:

Aave's infrastructure supports custom markets (e.g., Lido has created one, and others have as well). Aave supports immutable governance if needed. Aave even enables the use of your own token for governance under its friendly fork policy. If Polygon wanted more control over the investment strategy for the bridged assets, a tailored market could have been spawned easily, with the additional guarantees of a large and efficient Safety Module, that no other protocol has.

Aave is the most flexible lending infrastructure and capital-efficient system, built to cater to diverse use cases. V4 will be an even more exciting product.

The main feedback for Polygon was that Polygon users were unhappy about a network using their funds for high-risk investments without consent. The fact that Aave opened the discussion and took action to protect users is exactly what DAOs should do.

Framing Aave DAO's proposal as anti-competitive behavior is inaccurate and diverts attention from the real issue: user security. Inheriting the risk of a third party protocol without the consent of the DAO is not something the Aave DAO is interested in and ACI took the steps required to define what's next for the Polygon market.

In my 8 years of building DeFi, this has been top-tier entertainment.

When it comes to Aave's leadership: we prioritize user safety above all else. Just use Aave.",133.0,False,-1.0,-1

8634,StaniKulechov,266069.0,2023/12/30 8:54:39,"2024 is going to be the most important year for DeFi.

My DeFi journey started 7 years ago when I became passionate about the idea of democratizing finance. Ethereum enabled a platform where financial enthusiasts like me could build open, accessible, and transparent financial infrastructure by reducing the need for centralized middlemen.

My first thought was that building on a public blockchain network would enable new programmable financial apps that would otherwise be difficult to build in traditional finance, especially when it comes to app-to-app composability. The barrier to innovation was ridiculously low. Build, compose, and deploy.

Stakes are higher. When we built the Aave Protocol V1 in January 2020, the whole DeFi TVL was sitting at $600M. A year later, Aave Protocol V1 TVL peaked at $2.6B, and our team already launched V2, which later in 2021 had a peak TVL sitting at nearly $20B.

Unlike many other DeFi Protocols, the Aave Protocol collects revenue directly into the DAO Treasury, which, in a decentralized fashion by governance voting, reimburses community members to finance development, smart contract security work, governance work, treasury management, risk management, and even infamous rAAVEs and other community events. Anyone can come to the DAO and create a proposal. What are the chances for an ordinary person to successfully suggest a proposal to a central bank or credit card network to change the way they operate? I reckon close to none.

As boring or as painful DAOs can be, they can actually be the right tool to govern an infrastructure that should be neutral and global.

Back to the fees. The Aave DAO is a net-positive DAO, meaning that after costs, it has enough revenue to leave a surplus. It's not a business; it's more akin to using democracy to govern a vital public infrastructure (this is how the internet would be governed if crypto-economics existed back then).

Based on the fees some of the DeFi Protocols are earning and the usage, we can strongly argue that DeFi has Protocol-Market Fit. It's the only category that has PMF in web3.

Over the past couple of years, it became more clear that L2 Rollups (and subnets, etc.) might be the way to scale blockspace. Since blockchain enables financialization and monetization, these rollups would all need to figure out a financial layer to serve whatever use-case they are seeking after (i.e., web3 social, regen, or gaming). I like to draw an analogy for rollups as Towns, and each Town needs its own non-custodial bank.

The Aave community recognized early the demand for liquidity across networks. For that reason, the Aave Protocol is deployed over multiple networks, and most likely we will see additional networks during 2024. I also believe that smart and resourceful DeFi communities will seek new market share from non-EVM networks.

I've never been as excited about DeFi as I am today. Mainly because today we have DeFi protocols that have reached PMF, are enabling financial layers across various networks (Ethereum, L2s such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Scroll, Metis, and ZkSync, Avalanche, and Polygon), and are truly decentralized or progressing towards decentralization. DeFi used to crawl; now it's walking and from now on is preparing for a run.

Especially lower transaction fees would give DeFi a fair shot at building payment infrastructure and bring web3 closer to consumer usage. This vision is part of what GHO could be, bringing web3 payments into mainstream.

While there are DeFi Protocols that are moving towards the growth stage, there are plenty of challenges ahead that the whole community has an opportunity to work on.

Here are a few:

- Ungovernance, less governance where it's not needed
- Bringing meritocracy into DeFi governance to diversify one token one vote mechanism
- Stay sufficiently decentralized (DAOs need to be factually decentralized. A great test is whether the protocol would function if the founding team would move on)
- Risk management tooling improvements
- Smart Contract security tools are still non-existent
- Moving seamlessly and securely liquidity around multiple networks
- L2s can have more liquidity when they stop acting like databases and have better fault tolerance against a single point of failures (taking off the training wheels)

For the Aave ecosystem, during 2024, I will be expecting more new innovation. There is so much innovation that can be done on liquidity markets and decentralized stablecoins and other areas the Aave community should look into. I am also even more excited to see new participants in the Aave governance.

For the whole DeFi community, I wish you a successful 2024 and want to remind you that you are contributing to building a better, accessible financial system; you are all heroes in this journey.

Wishing all you degens an amazing 2024! üëª

Ethereum can do more with an efficient and sustainable foundation that fuels the ecosystem and empowers all the successful applications on Ethereum, which is mainly DeFi, for now.

Less caring should go into internal politics or neutrality and more focus should go into advancing the technology as fast as possible.

Ethereum is in a good position since its creator is still heavily involved in advancing the technology after 10 years, interacting with the community and taking actions even when the feedback is unpleasant.

EF taking already actions is extremely strong signal.

Winning means advancing roadmaps, finding breakthrough research, onboarding more smart talent and making a more appealing product, the Ethereum Network.

GHO stablecoin as a gas token, zk proofs submitted to Ethereum, Avail DA to store the L2 state, horizontal scaling with ZKsync. We are going very low on fees.

Decentralized storage is built-in so no need to worry about pinning or loosing content. Also enables onchain access control over content on decentralized storage. First time ever users/DAOs can manage data together offchain with onchain access control rules. Will be secured by Ethereum down the line.

Also smart contract-based social primitives that can simply be plugged into any app: Feeds, Graphs, Groups, Usernames and all have rules engine to extend the smart contract-based rules.

More contracts will be shipped. ICOs, governance and new token primitives and other fun things including DeFi.

All apps will have support for gasless and signless with email or phone out of the box.

On Monday, I had a mock fight with some experienced fighters at my gym, in order to gain some real fight experience ahead of the fight next week.

Quiet literally this has been some of the worst pain I've ever been in. Engaging my core in any way gets up to 8/10 on the pain scale. 

This isn't the timeline I wanted, obviously. 

Despite the numerous injuries and bruises I've sustained over the last 2 months, training for the fight has been a surprisingly fun experience, and I'm glad @nic__carter brought this opportunity in the first place.

I'm sure Nic has been training very hard for this, and I'm super bummed to rob this opportunity from both of us. 

Sadly, ignoring the rib and doing the fight anyway isn't a possibility. One shot to the gut and I would be crippled. It wouldn't be the fight either of us want or deserve.

* Improve two-way communications and ties between EF leadership and the ecosystem actors, old and new, that it is our role to support: users (individual and institutional), app devs, wallets, L2s
* Bring in fresh talent, improve execution ability and speed
* Become more actively supportive of app builders, and make sure important values and inalienable rights (esp privacy, open source, censorship resistance) are a reality for users including at the app layer
* Continue to increase our use of decentralized and privacy tech and the Ethereum chain, including for payments and treasury management

* Execute some kind of ideological / vibez pivot from feminized wef soyboy mentality to bronze age mindset

-Took a few vacations, private the entire way, about $150k-$200k each
-Moved into a 14 million $$ giant penthouse

I have driven the car like 3 times. I found the vacations barely tolerable after a few days. I like my house but I truly feel no big difference from it.

Why I share this with you. The above is near the pinnacle of how you can live $$ wise.

YET I STILL literally am only really happy when I am
-Building stuff
-Lifting/doing combat sports
-Eating right
-Progressing in hobbies (like guitar)
-In a good place with my wife
-Playing a good video game (If I'm being a piece of shit..I try not to do this..it ruins your head)

And following a routine that lets me do those things.

In short EVERYTHING I ever needed to be happy I had access to at the entry level of my career.

And there has been virtually nothing I can buy to increase it or have an elevated life experience.

It's not that I am some simple guy who like the little things in life. 

It's truly just that WE (you and I) have no where to ""escape"" or ""get to"" to in life that will make you finally ""good"".

There is no destination where your ""perma happy"" and everything is good.

If anything the best that destination will ever be is doing a similar routine/list to mine above on PERHAPS a bigger scale.

AKA building bigger stuff, excelling at your hobbies/things you enjoy more.

Simply put : The things you need to be good are likely already fully available to you.

One of them likely being working on something your excited about.

SO what you should REALLY focus on is not where the ""work"" is taking or WILL take you, since the only goal is to keep being able to work...

AND MORE so focus on max enjoying your basic things and maximizing them.

MOST people spend their life NOT enjoying/sacrificing thinking they will escape pain and boredom at a certain destination AND OR that becoming turbo wealthy will give them this.

The truth is once base needs are covered you can't get happier or more fulfilled. Your capped.

You can get small boost and highs. But more or less your capped and the things you already like doing are already the things you need to be happy.

This is not me saying ""don't get rich or spend money"". 

Its just me saying you might as well enjoy where you are right now because its pretty much as good as it ever gets if your achieving your simple list like mine above.

I‚Äôve had access to this from day one (minus my neon gay bar Jiu Jitsu garage).

Everyone in fact has access to this. Your peak happiness as a man is the cost of a coffee, laptop and wifi.

 In fact these can make your life actively worse as they can take your focus from the simple things that make you happy, especially if they financially stress you and turn your work from a ‚Äújoy‚Äù activity and into labor to pay for shit.

My point is you can stop worrying about ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù. You already likely have everything you need to be turbo happy. You can just choose to be happy.

(Like/Share/Comment for cool points)

My goal has been to do the fairest meme launch ever. This takes a bit of planning, hence my recent silence.

No more. I have partnered with @MeteoraAG and the kinks are unkinked. Here's how this will work.

Sometime in late February we will just drop an entry form out of nowhere.

It will be on my Twitter. It will be a main post on my feed. If you click/enter anything before that, your stupid and I don't care if you lose all my money.

In the event I get hacked (unlikely)...The form will require NO WALLET CONNECTION OR FUNDS.

I'd pay close attention to my content on Youtube and here as I will leave hints on the form drop time.

We will then collect an undecided amount of wallets (probably between 5,000 and 15,000).

People that are cool will likely have a cooler time than those that are uncool. If only there was some way to ensure coolness.

These wallets will have the meme dispersed to them equally. You will then be able to come at your leisure on the Solana blockchain and pick up your allocation. It is 100% free outside the gas which you will have to cover (should be very cheap).

We have ways to prevent this from being gamed. If you want to try to submit multiple wallets, spam it by all means try...You will just lose your spot. (We have AI waiting by to examine the logs)

It will be first come first serve. Entry will depend on how fast you are + how cool you are. Hence why the people that watch/collect the hints will reign supreme.

There is also CIPHER and MINI allocations. Assuming the coin runs to 100 mil a CIPHER allocation will likely be worth six figures. A mini allocation worth 5 figures.

Currently 3/10 ciphers have been one. 10 out 100 mini allocations have been won. 

Leading up to the drop I will be posting/hosting fucked up challenges. The winners/participants/people that solve my riddles and games will get the ciphers/minis.

These will be fully issued BEFORE the drop. When all are issued we are probably getting close.

On the actual drop it will AGAIN be posted on my main Twitter here. AGAIN you will NOT have to deposit ANYTHING to get your coins.

The link will be verified on my Youtube, Twitter and I will have Meteora confirm as well. You will NOT NEED TO RUSH OR FOMO as your coins will already be reserved. Please check all 3 confirmations.

We will probably ad more fail safes prior to drop.

On that note a reminder :
I am taking ABSOLUTELY zero income from this coin.

I will NEVER EVER hold any of this coin, trade it or collect any fee on it.

On the flip side I AM NOT DOING SHIT OR RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING after it drops. I am going to launch this nuclear bomb and go hide in a bush n laugh at the chaos.

Its totally on all the new holders hands the second I press go.

On another note a big thanks to @MeteoraAG  for stepping up to make a drop like this possible. It's pretty complicated to make this fully fair. They are by far the best meme launchers/platform on the market atm. Total top notch crew.

I assume other people will be looking to copy/do something similar after this (everyone copies the Alpha Papi KOL after all). If so use them. They have this down to a science.

ANY AND ALL FINAL DETAILS ARE IN THE DOC BELOW IN THE FIRST COMMENT.

THE NEXT CIPHER AND MINI ALLOCATION WILL BE THIS WEEKEND. 1 time hint will be dropped on Twitter and 1 on Youtube over the next 7 days.

My goal 
Is to absolute rub every prior meme coin ""fair launch"" face in the mud and make the fairest meme launch of the year to set a new standard for the industry.

NO WHALES
NO INSIDERS
NO DEV ALLOCATION
NO SNIPING
NO PRE SALE

100% free drop (minus gas) equally distributed among the first and most cult like followers.

I'm going to remind you one last time (on deaf ears) in the not so distant future this market will take everything back. MOST participants will suffer INCREDIBLE losses.

People will go bankrupt. Go to jail. Con each other. Steal.  Abandon projects. Be robbed on the platforms they store money on.

It will be bad. It always gets bad. You just haven't seen crypto dark side in awhile.

SO : While we are up and likely to be up quite a bit longer...(I'm by no means bearish right now)

Some quick tips (ESPECIALLY if your new/in your first run)

A) Don't extend yourself or push to hard
Your not a genius. Its a bull. Everything keeps going up so it seems like this isn't as risky as it actually is. 

If your semi new, this is not your big chance. Its your introductory class. Focus on learning. Your time is LIKELY next run. Don't force crazy balls out moves.

B) FOCUS on surviving till the bear. 
The bear is your chance. EVERYONE whose turbo rich here bought in the bear. We didn't tier 10 turbo gamble mid bull and make it.

C) DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING
Everyone lies here. No one predicts shit. No one has any clue what the market will due. Most who seem like geniuses or ""crypto savvy"" now will be revealed as idiots in the bear.

The hype/bad predictions/fomo these people insight is biblical. Do not drink the kool aid.

You can make a lot of money in crypto. But not as much as you THINK . It won't be as easy as you think.

It will take learning, time and LIKELY sitting through a 3 year boring bear period and buying this shit when no one wants anything to do with it.

Lower your expectation, expect to make some huge mistakes, lower or aim a bit. 

We are likely going to fly here. But make no mistake you are playing crypto at its most DANGEROUS point.

If you want to get rich. Like wealthy rich. Read this 3 times.

Money is simply a scoreboard. Like a sport the score reflect the SKILL/STRATEGY of the player.

Thus this is the TRUEST most CONSISTENT nearly GUARANTEED way to get rich. You simply have acquire skill and strategy. 

Frankly hard work/hours of direct work isn't even required at some points if you acquire enough of each.

How do we do this?

It's simple.

How do you get good at any sport? Whether its Super Smash Bros, Boxing, Jiu Jitsu, Golf?

A) You practice/play ALOT
B) You consistently raise the difficulty to expose your weaknesses and refine your talents.

So let's isolate this to a easy to understand metaphor that we will bring back to business n money.

If I want to get REALLY good at Jiu Jitsu, I need to go every day n train a lot.

This is not enough tho.

When I get to a level of skill, lets say being able to beat other low level opponents in the gym (white belts).

I need to then do two things
A) Isolate where I am weak
B) Expose where I must get better

How do I do the 2 things above?

The first step is to simply up the difficulty and fight better opponents. A bigger challenge will instantly expose where you are not good enough.

Then REVIEW/learn why you are losing in 2 ways.

What current skills do you have that must improve.

What NEW skills do you need.

Watch the tapes, recap what you did and what failed.

THEN ISOLATE and train with intent to fix these problems.

For example, lets say you fight a blue belt and your current take downs are not working. Let's also say they keep choking you, something you have not seen before.

POW : Whenever you train you need to SPECIFICALLY work on your take downs and SPECIFICALLY let your opponents get in positions to choke you for you to escape.

Do these 2 things. POW your leveling up really fast.

Then repeat this with volume (daily work) and its nearly IMPOSSIBLE for you not to gain skill and experience needed to level up.

You simply can't help but get better because you are pulling the DIRECT levers of ""getting gud"".

So lets apply this to money

Step 1 : We need to work at it every day. The end.

--------------------------------

Step 2 : We need to find low level opponents to gain experience/skill with.

An example of this would be starting a solo business where you freelance. Graphic design, photography, coding, hell mowing lawns. (I for example did SEO freelancing)

Mostly risk free to start and teaches you the base skill of selling.

Do this for 6 months till you can consistently sell your time.

-----------------------------------------------------

Step 3: LEVEL UP THE OPPONENT. Watch the tapes.

Once you can sufficiently sell your service just working daily at it IS NOT ENOUGH.

We need to IMPROVE our current skills and AD NEW ONES.

Improve : We could dramatically expand what our service offers or make the product better. We find out why clients left us and fix this.

Add : We can throw buying ads and doing social media 

POW : Your business is not only retaining clients better its also now adding MORE of them via advertising mastery.

AGAIN we must keep daily commitment to keep leveling up.

--------------------------------

Step 4 : REPEAT, Keep Upping The Opponent  Difficulty

We just need to repeat step 3 over and over.

And example of this would be : Now that we have a great service and advertising we HIRE people to do the work for us.

BOOM now we are leveling up our ability to build a company, systems, and be a business BUILDER...Not an employee/work inside the business.

You can now start to scale the business. The options are endless here. Expand the area, take other sectors, sell more services, etc etc. 

-----------------------------------------

That's it.
If you repeat the above
A) you will fail A LOT due to constantly leveling up. You'll mis-hire, F up your product, pick a bad niche etc etc. 

Each time you fail, your watching the tapes, you fix it and gain EXPERIENCE.

B) On a long enough time frame you level up to EXTREMELY complex high level business. Raising money, selling businesses, building huge teams.

Even if your doing something totally solo (say trading) your gonna start to get beyond lethal.

The above strategy is how any regardless of talent can isolate becoming very successful down to a few simple rules.

1. Do it every day with effort
2. Up the opponent difficulty
3. Repeat step 1 and 2

I started out JUST like this. 

-I did solo SEO for businesses (my first 6)
-Then I sold outsourced SEO (my first 7 figures)
-Then I made SEO software for them
-Then I mastered ads for SEO
-Then I sold information AND SEO via ads/social media (My first 8 figures)
-Then I sold  ad SOFTWARE for SEO agencies, info sellers, etc (my first 9 figure business)

The end. I did not grammar check this.

Your goal is NOT to get 100x rich. It's to make enough to invest to FULLY live passively off 5% APY from the stored money. (AKA 1 mill at 5% gives you 50k a year)

WHY : The #1 edge in money is TIME. When you buy yourself TIME by not needing a job due to passive income you have TONS of time to focus on making MORE money.

This is why entrepreneurs income usually skyrockets when they finally make enough to go full time.

IF you receive the BLESSING of luck in crypto and make enough to do this (1-2 million) EXIT IMMEDIATELY.

Then set yourself free. THEN spend all your time trying to get turbo rich.

It is EXTREMELY hard to get turbo rich if you have to work 40-50 hours a week on something else.

You want those full 40-50 hours going STRAIGHT towards leveling yourself up.

You can only do that if you have a GIANT backstop safety net in passive income.

This is goal #1. If you achieve big enough gains to live passively, that's it. You're done. Exit 90%, set up passive income, start over with 10% in crypto.

You will likely not get many chances like this in your lifetime, setting yourself up for 100% time freedom is your ABSOLUTE #1 first goal.

THEN after that try to get turbo rich SECOND.

#1 : Set up passive income for life time freedom
#2 : Try to get turbo rich

NEVER risk #1 going for #2.

Hence why I did not sell enough around the Trump election. That was clearly the time to dump alts and misreading ETH was fatal.

The pivot now is this : It very much looks like Trump is forcing low rates.

I don‚Äôt think people remember just how crazy markets moved when the printer was on and rates were low.

I see Trump forcing low rates and then pumping all risk markets.

With the rate he and institutions are buying ETH I‚Äôm pretty sure we see the new ETH aths.

Alts will return to their ATHs in single weekly candles when this happens.

The plan is be bored, hold and eat shit right now. 

Times like this are by far the toughest in crypto because not only are losses more likely than gains‚Ä¶.its also boring and an absolute chore staying actving.

Mark thy jelly‚Äôs tho: These points will deliver outlandish gains when we start to run.
